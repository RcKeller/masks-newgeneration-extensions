# Overview of _Masks_

_Masks_ is a tabletop roleplaying game about young superheroes exploring identity, relationships, and heroism. Characters are part of a team trying to figure out who they are while juggling personal lives and saving Halcyon City. The system uses a collaborative conversation model (dialogue between players and GM), supported by lightweight mechanics to resolve uncertain outcomes and push story forward.

## Core Concepts and Structures

### 1. Conversation & Framing Scenes

*   **The game flows through conversation** among players and the GM. Everyone describes what their characters do, think, and feel.
    
*   **Scenes** are framed like comic book panels: a location, the characters present, and a situation that drives action. Scenes should start in medias res or move to where interesting decisions need to be made, often with the question, “What do you do?”
    
*   **Playing to Find Out**: Instead of planning outcomes, players discover the story by reacting to mechanics and the fiction. That uncertainty is part of the game’s fun.
    

### 2. Moves

Moves are structured triggers with associated outcomes. To trigger a move, characters must actually do what the move requires. If uncertain about what happens next, consult the move.

**Types of Moves:**

*   **Basic Moves**: Common actions available to all characters, such as directly engage a threat, unleash your powers, defend someone, assess the situation, provoke someone, comfort or support someone, and pierce someone’s mask.
    
*   **Playbook Moves**: Special moves unique to each playbook, highlighting a character’s niche.
    
*   **Team Moves**: Trigger when heroes share a triumphant celebration or a vulnerability/weakness.
    
*   **GM Moves**: The GM uses these to drive conflict when the narrative stalls, or when players roll a miss.
    
*   **Adult Moves**: Late in the campaign, characters can unlock mature, more potent moves (e.g., overwhelming a vulnerable foe, persuading someone with their best interests).
    

**Rolling Dice:**

*   Most moves instruct players to roll 2d6 and add a relevant Label or other modifiers.
    
*   **Results**:
    
    *   **10+ (Strong Hit)**: A full success, granting best results.
        
    *   **7-9 (Weak Hit)**: A partial success with complications or costs.
        
    *   **6- (Miss)**: The move fails or the GM makes a hard move against the character.
        

### 3. Labels

Labels measure how characters see themselves and how others perceive them. Each character has five Labels:

*   **Danger**: How threatening/powerful they feel.
    
*   **Freak**: How strange/unique they feel.
    
*   **Savior**: How protective/self-sacrificing they are.
    
*   **Superior**: How capable and clever they feel relative to others.
    
*   **Mundane**: How ordinary/human they feel.
    

**Label Shifts**:

*   Characters’ Labels change frequently—triggered by influence, moves, or in-character choices.
    
*   When a Label changes, another must shift in the opposite direction unless it’s locked (±3 or –2).
    
*   If a shift would push past the extremes, no shift happens and the player marks a condition instead.
    

### 4. Influence

*   **Influence** represents how much a character cares about someone else’s opinion.
    
*   Characters must track who holds Influence over them and over whom they have Influence.
    
*   **Gaining Influence** allows someone to shift the target’s Labels (following the fiction).
    
*   Influence can be used or given up to push narrative changes (e.g., take an extra +1, inflict a condition).
    

### 5. Conditions

When things go wrong, characters mark conditions—negative emotional states that hinder performance:

*   **Afraid**: –2 to directly engage a threat
    
*   **Angry**: –2 to comfort/support or pierce the mask
    
*   **Guilty**: –2 to provoke or assess
    
*   **Hopeless**: –2 to unleash powers
    
*   **Insecure**: –2 to defend or reject others’ Influence
    

Characters clear conditions through specific actions (e.g., venting anger, acting to absolve guilt, or through specific moves).

### 6. Team & Team Pool

*   **Team Pool** is a collective resource used to enhance rolls or aid teammates in combat.
    
*   Team points are gained at the start of battle (and via moves) and spent to give +1 to a teammate’s roll or to act selfishly to raise your own Label temporarily.
    
*   Scenes start with 1 team by default or more if entering battle with a dangerous foe as a team.
    

### 7. Moment of Truth

Each playbook has a “Moment of Truth” (unlocked via advancement). In this dramatic scene, players get full narrative control to show off why their character embodies their archetype and to change the story fundamentally. After, one Label locks permanently, reflecting the character’s epiphany.

### 8. Advancement & Growth

Characters mark potential on misses. After five misses, they earn an “advancement” (new move, Label shift, or unlocking their Moment of Truth). After five core advancements, characters can take adult moves, switch playbooks, or retire.

## Playbooks (Character Archetypes)


Each playbook provides:

*   A narrative archetype,
    
*   A set of abilities/powers,
    
*   Unique moves, extras, and backstory questions,
    
*   A specific relationship prompt (“When our team first came together...”),
    
*   Influence assignment rules.
    

**The core playbooks include:**

1.  **Beacon**: A hopeful, “ordinary” hero who compensates with gadgetry or minor powers; focused on drives (small personal goals) and proving they belong on the team.
    
2.  **Bull**: A tough, super-strong brawler created (or forged) for violence. Central moves focus on love, rivalry, and roles like Defender, Friend, Listener, or Enabler.
    
3.  **Delinquent**: A rebellious troublemaker using tricks, deception, and provoking to push boundaries. Emphasizes conflict with authority and challenging convention.
    
4.  **Doomed**: A powerful hero with a tragic fate (doom), tracked via a doom track and doomsigns. They wrestle with power’s cost, their nemesis, and their ultimate demise.
    
5.  **Janus**: A masked hero balancing normal life and superhero identity. Handles secret identities, obligations, and shifting between mundane and superheroic roles.
    
6.  **Legacy**: A member of a long line of heroes bound by tradition and duty. They’re judged by predecessors and must either uphold or redefine their heritage.
    
7.  **Nova**: The powerhouse struggling to control vast energy. Uses flares and Burn to do large-scale magic/science feats but risks collateral damage and loss of control.
    
8.  **Outsider**: An alien or otherworldly being trying to fit into Earth’s society. Uses advanced technology, culture clashes, and a strong sense of belonging.
    
9.  **Protégé**: The sidekick or trainee of an established hero, wrestling with following their mentor’s path or forging their own. Handles guidance, rebellion, and legacy.
    
10.  **Transformed**: Once human, now monstrous in form; deals with prejudice, isolation, and finding acceptance or embracing monstrous power.

11. **Brain**: genius, inventions, shame

12.  **Harbinger**: time-traveler (added above)

13.  **Innocent**: past self vs. feared future self

14.  **Joined**: two PCs, bonds/distinctions, power together/apart

15.  **Newborn**: created being, lessons, regeneration/damaged

16.  **Nomad**: far-traveler, “Putting Down Roots” Influence rules

17.  **Reformed**: ex-villain, obligations, low places

18.  **Scion**: villain’s child, respect tracks & lineage pressure

19.  **Soldier**: A.E.G.I.S. operative, Soldier Label & orders

20.  **Star**: audience, PR, celebrity demands
    

## GM Guidance


### Key Principles for the GM:

*   **Describe Halcyon City like a comic**: evocative, visually rich, and mindful of pacing.
    
*   **Always address the heroes**: Keep focus on characters, their feelings, and their choices.
    
*   **Make moves but misdirect**: Don’t telegraph game mechanics—embed them in fictional description.
    
*   **Make threats real**: Show stakes—endanger innocents, highlight collateral costs, and enforce outcomes.
    
*   **Offer chances for failure**: Let villains escape, give heroes tough choices, and create lasting repercussions.
    
*   **Push Labels and Influence**: NPCs (especially adults) use Influence to shift Labels or force players to consider/reject advice.
    
*   **Support conditionally**: Adults offer help with strings attached; PCs must accept or push back.
    
*   **Draw on generational history**: Halcyon City has four generations of heroes; bring in mentors, past mistakes, legacies, and evolving ideals.
    
*   **Think in “gutters” between panels**: The world moves between scenes; keep track of unseen villain actions, evolving threats, and results of missed moves.
    
*   **Ask provocative questions**: Encourage players to expand the world—backstory details, relationships, or philosophical quandaries.
    
*   **Be a fan of the PCs**: Give them opportunities to shine, but also challenge them to grow and change.
    

### Villains & Threats:

*   Each villain has a drive (motivation), moves, and conditions (as NPC equivalents to PCs’ conditions). Villains mark a condition on each hit and respond immediately with more aggressive moves.
    

### Hooks & Arcs:

*   To structure longer campaigns, the GM builds “hooks” (pairs of NPCs who pull a PC’s Labels in opposite directions) and “arcs” (multi-phase stories—corruption, invasion, restriction, destruction, restoration) that allow campaigns to evolve.
    

### Custom Moves & Spin-offs:

*   The GM can create custom moves for special situations, environment hazards, or evolving powers. Moves should trigger on interesting and uncertain situations and deliver results that push the fiction forward.
    
*   Spin-off rules allow major system overhauls (e.g., changing how Influence works, adding harm/injury mechanics). Use carefully to ensure tone remains consistent.

## List of GM Moves

Here are the **standard GM moves in MASKS** and quick, practical ways to **bake each one directly into a villain move’s text**—so when you fire the villain move, you’re also cleanly making a GM move.

> **How to write them:**
> *Villain does a clear fiction-first thing → you present a cost/choice/consequence → you tag the mechanical effect (conditions, Influence, Team, etc.).*
> (Use “soft” phrasing when you’re setting up danger or a choice; use “hard” phrasing when you’re cashing it in.)

## The GM Moves (with villain‑text examples)

### 1) **Make a Villain Move**

**What it is:** Use one of the custom moves on that specific villain’s sheet.
**Write it like:** *“When [villain] does X, [fiction happens]. PCs must [choice] or [effect].”*
**Example:** “**Cut!** He points at the last hero action that changed something. **Choice**: keep it but **mark 2 conditions**, or redo it at **–2** under reshoot pressure.” (This is how *The Director* bakes GM pressure directly into his villain text.) 

---

### 2) **Make a Playbook Move**

**What it is:** Trigger a relevant adult/organization/NPC playbook move.
**Write it like:** *“Invoke [organization/adult move] to [tilt the scene]. On a hit, [spotlight shifts/effect].”*
**Example:** “A.E.G.I.S. deploys a **protocol move** that locks down the block; anyone who presses through acts **under scrutiny (–1 to the next relevant result)**.”

(*The Director* lists “Make a Playbook Move” right on his card to remind you this is always on the table.) 

---

### 3) **Activate the Downsides of their Abilities and Relationships**

**What it is:** Spotlight a teen’s complications, entanglements, or move downsides.
**Write it like:** *“Your power/relationship backfires; to push through, mark a condition or accept [new complication].”*
**Example:** “The EMP spikes your suit’s failsafe—**mark Insecure** or your armor **cuts out** for a panel.”

(*The Director*’s kit explicitly includes this GM move.) 

---

### 4) **Inflict a Condition**

**What it is:** Your primary “damage.”
**Write it like:** *“X hits home; choose **[Condition]** (or GM picks) unless you [costly mitigation].”*
**Example:** “The crowd’s jeers sting—**mark Insecure** unless you open up honestly in front of them.” (See also how *Fiddle Fiends* force **Insecure** and **Afraid/Hopeless** via crowd pressure.) 
*(Conditions are core to basic moves like **Take a Powerful Blow**, and to **Influence**—that’s why inflicting/clearing them is so potent.)* 

---

### 5) **Take Influence over Someone**

**What it is:** Adults and social threats assert narrative power over a teen’s self‑image.
**Write it like:** *“If you bite on their frame, they **gain Influence**; if you defy it, **mark a condition** or face [cost].”*
**Example:** “**Per My Last Email…** Sharon reframes your actions as policy violations—**she takes Influence** unless you accept a penalty (**–1 on the next result**) or **mark a fitting Condition**.” (*Sharon from HR*) 
*(See the Influence rules for how that leverage plays out.)* 

---

### 6) **Bring Them Together**

**What it is:** Push teamwork, shared purpose, and Team economy.
**Write it like:** *“If you coordinate, **+1 Team** or gain an opening; if you don’t, escalate [threat/effect].”*
**Example:** “Choreo the defense as a **duet**; on a clear signal, **add 1 Team**. If you grandstand alone, the hazard spreads to bystanders.” (*Pairs neatly with Enter Battle as a Team.*) 

---

### 7) **Capture Someone**

**What it is:** Separate/secure a target.
**Write it like:** *“They isolate a hero; accept a **compromise** to stay free or you’re **captured**.”*
**Example:** “**Mandatory 1:1.** Sharon peels you into a ‘quick chat’—go now and **lose time/reputation**, or **security escorts you out** (you’re effectively **captured**).” 

---

### 8) **Put Innocents in Danger**

**What it is:** Classic superhero pressure.
**Write it like:** *“X endangers civilians; if you don’t split attention to save them, [consequence/Condition].”*
**Example:** “**Stampede.** The fan swarm breaks into dangerous currents through traffic—**civilians are in peril** unless someone pivots to rescue.” (*Fiddle Fiends*) 

---

### 9) **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage**

**What it is:** Make the fallout vivid and mechanical.
**Write it like:** *“Your big swing cracks the support; either **mark Guilty** or **spend Team** to shore it up.”*
**Example:** “The stage rigging buckles. Keep pressing and **mark Guilty**, or burn **1 Team** to stabilize it on the fly.” (*Explicitly listed on The Director*) 

---

### 10) **Reveal the Future**

**What it is:** Foreshadow clocks, moves, or next issue’s threat.
**Write it like:** *“A teaser panel lands: unless you do X soon, expect Y next scene.”*
**Example:** “A push alert: *‘A.E.G.I.S. vote in 10 minutes.’* If you don’t sway it, **adult oversight** lands next scene with stricter rules.”

---

### 11) **Announce Between‑Panel Threats**

**What it is:** Advance off‑screen danger or call in reinforcements.
**Write it like:** *“While you’re busy, [new element] is already in motion.”*
**Example:** “**And… action!** All other enemies who haven’t acted take **an extra villain move now**—the set explodes with activity.” (*The Director*) 

---

### 12) **Make Them Pay a Price for Victory**

**What it is:** They can win, but it costs.
**Write it like:** *“You can have it if you accept [cost: conditions, split, lost asset].”*
**Example:** “Slam the vault shut and you’ll **seal the bomb inside**—but **mark Hopeless** from the weight of that choice.”
(*See The Director’s **Cut!**—keep the win but **mark 2 conditions**, or retake under pressure.*) 

---

### 13) **Turn Their Move Back on Them**

**What it is:** Mirror their tactic; twist the knife.
**Write it like:** *“That clever gambit rebounds; suffer [mirrored effect] unless you change approach.”*
**Example:** “Your sonic burst feeds the villain’s **resonance cage**—either **mark Afraid** and drop it, or they trap an ally inside.”

(*Explicitly present in The Director’s move list: Counter/Reverse.*) 

---

### 14) **Tell Them the Possible Consequences—and Ask**

**What it is:** Offer informed choice; keep agency front‑and‑center.
**Write it like:** *“If you do it this way, here’s what’ll happen—do you proceed?”*
**Example:** “Break the non‑compete and **legal comes down** on your mentor; do you go through with it?”
(*Sharon’s ‘Per My Last Email…’ is a great example of reframing and presenting costs up front.*) 

---

### 15) **Tell Them Who They Are or Who They Should Be**

**What it is:** Adults/antagonists press Labels and identity.
**Write it like:** *“They define you; if you accept, shift Labels their way; if you reject, roll to resist and face fallout.”*
**Example:** “*‘You’re just a PR product.’* Accept it to shift toward **Superior**, or reject and risk **Insecure** in front of the cameras.”
*(Ties directly into **Influence** and **Rejecting Influence**.)* 

---

### 16) **Bring an NPC to Rash Decisions and Hard Conclusions**

**What it is:** NPCs escalate fast—panic, betray, strike.
**Write it like:** *“X snaps; unless you intervene, they do Y immediately.”*
**Example:** “The venue manager **pulls the fire alarm**; if you don’t calm them now, **everyone evacuates** and the villain slips away.”
(*The Director* names this explicitly—great for speeding a scene to consequence.) 

---

## Quick templates you can paste into a villain sheet

* **[GM: Inflict a Condition]** “Their [attack/words] land. **Mark [Condition]**, or [costly mitigation].”
* **[GM: Take Influence]** “If you accept their framing, they **take Influence**; if you refuse, **mark [Condition]** or suffer [penalty].”
* **[GM: Put Innocents in Danger]** “X endangers bystanders; if you don’t split to help, [escalate/cost].”
* **[GM: Price for Victory]** “You can have it **if** you accept [loss/Condition/Team –1].”
* **[GM: Consequences & Ask]** “If you do it this way, [bad thing] happens—do you proceed?”

> **See it in action:**
> • *Fiddle Fiends* (crowd hazard) uses **Put Innocents in Danger** and **Inflict Conditions** (“Stampede,” “Mosh Pit,” “Seek Validation”). 
> • *Sharon from HR* (bureaucratic/social) shows **Take Influence**, **Capture Someone**, and **Consequences & Ask** (“Per My Last Email…,” “Mandatory 1:1,” “Performance Improvement Plan”). 
> • *The Director* (meta‑producer) literally lists the GM move set and implements **Price for Victory**, **Between‑Panel Threats**, etc. (“Cut!,” “And… action!”).

### Design tips (fast)

* **Name the feeling** in your villain move title (“Fan Fury,” “Safety First”) and **tag the GM move** in the body—this keeps fiction foremost and mechanics transparent. (You can also mirror what’s in your players’ basic moves and Influence rules so consequences feel integrated.) 
* **Soft first, hard later.** Offer a choice or foreshadow (soft), then cash it in with conditions, capture, or collateral (hard).
* **Aim moves at identity.** MASKS sings when GM moves threaten Labels/Influence as much as bodies and buildings.
