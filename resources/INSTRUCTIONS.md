# Overview of _Masks_

_Masks_ is a tabletop roleplaying game about young superheroes exploring identity, relationships, and heroism. Characters are part of a team trying to figure out who they are while juggling personal lives and saving Halcyon City. The system uses a collaborative conversation model (dialogue between players and GM), supported by lightweight mechanics to resolve uncertain outcomes and push story forward.

## Core Concepts and Structures

### 1. Conversation & Framing Scenes

*   **The game flows through conversation** among players and the GM. Everyone describes what their characters do, think, and feel.
    
*   **Scenes** are framed like comic book panels: a location, the characters present, and a situation that drives action. Scenes should start in medias res or move to where interesting decisions need to be made, often with the question, “What do you do?”
    
*   **Playing to Find Out**: Instead of planning outcomes, players discover the story by reacting to mechanics and the fiction. That uncertainty is part of the game’s fun.
    

### 2. Moves

Moves are structured triggers with associated outcomes. To trigger a move, characters must actually do what the move requires. If uncertain about what happens next, consult the move.

**Types of Moves:**

*   **Basic Moves**: Common actions available to all characters, such as directly engage a threat, unleash your powers, defend someone, assess the situation, provoke someone, comfort or support someone, and pierce someone’s mask.
    
*   **Playbook Moves**: Special moves unique to each playbook, highlighting a character’s niche.
    
*   **Team Moves**: Trigger when heroes share a triumphant celebration or a vulnerability/weakness.
    
*   **GM Moves**: The GM uses these to drive conflict when the narrative stalls, or when players roll a miss.
    
*   **Adult Moves**: Late in the campaign, characters can unlock mature, more potent moves (e.g., overwhelming a vulnerable foe, persuading someone with their best interests).
    

**Rolling Dice:**

*   Most moves instruct players to roll 2d6 and add a relevant Label or other modifiers.
    
*   **Results**:
    
    *   **10+ (Strong Hit)**: A full success, granting best results.
        
    *   **7-9 (Weak Hit)**: A partial success with complications or costs.
        
    *   **6- (Miss)**: The move fails or the GM makes a hard move against the character.
        

### 3. Labels

Labels measure how characters see themselves and how others perceive them. Each character has five Labels:

*   **Danger**: How threatening/powerful they feel.
    
*   **Freak**: How strange/unique they feel.
    
*   **Savior**: How protective/self-sacrificing they are.
    
*   **Superior**: How capable and clever they feel relative to others.
    
*   **Mundane**: How ordinary/human they feel.
    

**Label Shifts**:

*   Characters’ Labels change frequently—triggered by influence, moves, or in-character choices.
    
*   When a Label changes, another must shift in the opposite direction unless it’s locked (±3 or –2).
    
*   If a shift would push past the extremes, no shift happens and the player marks a condition instead.
    

### 4. Influence

*   **Influence** represents how much a character cares about someone else’s opinion.
    
*   Characters must track who holds Influence over them and over whom they have Influence.
    
*   **Gaining Influence** allows someone to shift the target’s Labels (following the fiction).
    
*   Influence can be used or given up to push narrative changes (e.g., take an extra +1, inflict a condition).
    

### 5. Conditions

When things go wrong, characters mark conditions—negative emotional states that hinder performance:

*   **Afraid**: –2 to directly engage a threat
    
*   **Angry**: –2 to comfort/support or pierce the mask
    
*   **Guilty**: –2 to provoke or assess
    
*   **Hopeless**: –2 to unleash powers
    
*   **Insecure**: –2 to defend or reject others’ Influence
    

Characters clear conditions through specific actions (e.g., venting anger, acting to absolve guilt, or through specific moves).

### 6. Team & Team Pool

*   **Team Pool** is a collective resource used to enhance rolls or aid teammates in combat.
    
*   Team points are gained at the start of battle (and via moves) and spent to give +1 to a teammate’s roll or to act selfishly to raise your own Label temporarily.
    
*   Scenes start with 1 team by default or more if entering battle with a dangerous foe as a team.
    

### 7. Moment of Truth

Each playbook has a “Moment of Truth” (unlocked via advancement). In this dramatic scene, players get full narrative control to show off why their character embodies their archetype and to change the story fundamentally. After, one Label locks permanently, reflecting the character’s epiphany.

### 8. Advancement & Growth

Characters mark potential on misses. After five misses, they earn an “advancement” (new move, Label shift, or unlocking their Moment of Truth). After five core advancements, characters can take adult moves, switch playbooks, or retire.

## Playbooks (Character Archetypes)


Each playbook provides:

*   A narrative archetype,
    
*   A set of abilities/powers,
    
*   Unique moves, extras, and backstory questions,
    
*   A specific relationship prompt (“When our team first came together...”),
    
*   Influence assignment rules.
    

**The core playbooks include:**

1.  **Beacon**: A hopeful, “ordinary” hero who compensates with gadgetry or minor powers; focused on drives (small personal goals) and proving they belong on the team.
    
2.  **Bull**: A tough, super-strong brawler created (or forged) for violence. Central moves focus on love, rivalry, and roles like Defender, Friend, Listener, or Enabler.
    
3.  **Delinquent**: A rebellious troublemaker using tricks, deception, and provoking to push boundaries. Emphasizes conflict with authority and challenging convention.
    
4.  **Doomed**: A powerful hero with a tragic fate (doom), tracked via a doom track and doomsigns. They wrestle with power’s cost, their nemesis, and their ultimate demise.
    
5.  **Janus**: A masked hero balancing normal life and superhero identity. Handles secret identities, obligations, and shifting between mundane and superheroic roles.
    
6.  **Legacy**: A member of a long line of heroes bound by tradition and duty. They’re judged by predecessors and must either uphold or redefine their heritage.
    
7.  **Nova**: The powerhouse struggling to control vast energy. Uses flares and Burn to do large-scale magic/science feats but risks collateral damage and loss of control.
    
8.  **Outsider**: An alien or otherworldly being trying to fit into Earth’s society. Uses advanced technology, culture clashes, and a strong sense of belonging.
    
9.  **Protégé**: The sidekick or trainee of an established hero, wrestling with following their mentor’s path or forging their own. Handles guidance, rebellion, and legacy.
    
10.  **Transformed**: Once human, now monstrous in form; deals with prejudice, isolation, and finding acceptance or embracing monstrous power.

11. **Brain**: genius, inventions, shame

12.  **Harbinger**: time-traveler (added above)

13.  **Innocent**: past self vs. feared future self

14.  **Joined**: two PCs, bonds/distinctions, power together/apart

15.  **Newborn**: created being, lessons, regeneration/damaged

16.  **Nomad**: far-traveler, “Putting Down Roots” Influence rules

17.  **Reformed**: ex-villain, obligations, low places

18.  **Scion**: villain’s child, respect tracks & lineage pressure

19.  **Soldier**: A.E.G.I.S. operative, Soldier Label & orders

20.  **Star**: audience, PR, celebrity demands
    

## GM Guidance


### Key Principles for the GM:

*   **Describe Halcyon City like a comic**: evocative, visually rich, and mindful of pacing.
    
*   **Always address the heroes**: Keep focus on characters, their feelings, and their choices.
    
*   **Make moves but misdirect**: Don’t telegraph game mechanics—embed them in fictional description.
    
*   **Make threats real**: Show stakes—endanger innocents, highlight collateral costs, and enforce outcomes.
    
*   **Offer chances for failure**: Let villains escape, give heroes tough choices, and create lasting repercussions.
    
*   **Push Labels and Influence**: NPCs (especially adults) use Influence to shift Labels or force players to consider/reject advice.
    
*   **Support conditionally**: Adults offer help with strings attached; PCs must accept or push back.
    
*   **Draw on generational history**: Halcyon City has four generations of heroes; bring in mentors, past mistakes, legacies, and evolving ideals.
    
*   **Think in “gutters” between panels**: The world moves between scenes; keep track of unseen villain actions, evolving threats, and results of missed moves.
    
*   **Ask provocative questions**: Encourage players to expand the world—backstory details, relationships, or philosophical quandaries.
    
*   **Be a fan of the PCs**: Give them opportunities to shine, but also challenge them to grow and change.
    

### Villains & Threats:

*   Each villain has a drive (motivation), moves, and conditions (as NPC equivalents to PCs’ conditions). Villains mark a condition on each hit and respond immediately with more aggressive moves.
    

### Hooks & Arcs:

*   To structure longer campaigns, the GM builds “hooks” (pairs of NPCs who pull a PC’s Labels in opposite directions) and “arcs” (multi-phase stories—corruption, invasion, restriction, destruction, restoration) that allow campaigns to evolve.
    

### Custom Moves & Spin-offs:

*   The GM can create custom moves for special situations, environment hazards, or evolving powers. Moves should trigger on interesting and uncertain situations and deliver results that push the fiction forward.
    
*   Spin-off rules allow major system overhauls (e.g., changing how Influence works, adding harm/injury mechanics). Use carefully to ensure tone remains consistent.
