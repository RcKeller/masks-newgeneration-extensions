# Overview of _Masks_

_Masks_ is a tabletop roleplaying game about young superheroes exploring identity, relationships, and heroism. Characters are part of a team trying to figure out who they are while juggling personal lives and saving Halcyon City. The system uses a collaborative conversation model (dialogue between players and GM), supported by lightweight mechanics to resolve uncertain outcomes and push story forward.

## Core Concepts and Structures

### 1. Conversation & Framing Scenes

*   **The game flows through conversation** among players and the GM. Everyone describes what their characters do, think, and feel.
    
*   **Scenes** are framed like comic book panels: a location, the characters present, and a situation that drives action. Scenes should start in medias res or move to where interesting decisions need to be made, often with the question, “What do you do?”
    
*   **Playing to Find Out**: Instead of planning outcomes, players discover the story by reacting to mechanics and the fiction. That uncertainty is part of the game’s fun.
    

### 2. Moves

Moves are structured triggers with associated outcomes. To trigger a move, characters must actually do what the move requires. If uncertain about what happens next, consult the move.

**Types of Moves:**

*   **Basic Moves**: Common actions available to all characters, such as directly engage a threat, unleash your powers, defend someone, assess the situation, provoke someone, comfort or support someone, and pierce someone’s mask.
    
*   **Playbook Moves**: Special moves unique to each playbook, highlighting a character’s niche.
    
*   **Team Moves**: Trigger when heroes share a triumphant celebration or a vulnerability/weakness.
    
*   **GM Moves**: The GM uses these to drive conflict when the narrative stalls, or when players roll a miss.
    
*   **Adult Moves**: Late in the campaign, characters can unlock mature, more potent moves (e.g., overwhelming a vulnerable foe, persuading someone with their best interests).
    

**Rolling Dice:**

*   Most moves instruct players to roll 2d6 and add a relevant Label or other modifiers.
    
*   **Results**:
    
    *   **10+ (Strong Hit)**: A full success, granting best results.
        
    *   **7-9 (Weak Hit)**: A partial success with complications or costs.
        
    *   **6- (Miss)**: The move fails or the GM makes a hard move against the character.
        

### 3. Labels

Labels measure how characters see themselves and how others perceive them. Each character has five Labels:

*   **Danger**: How threatening/powerful they feel.
    
*   **Freak**: How strange/unique they feel.
    
*   **Savior**: How protective/self-sacrificing they are.
    
*   **Superior**: How capable and clever they feel relative to others.
    
*   **Mundane**: How ordinary/human they feel.
    

**Label Shifts**:

*   Characters’ Labels change frequently—triggered by influence, moves, or in-character choices.
    
*   When a Label changes, another must shift in the opposite direction unless it’s locked (±3 or –2).
    
*   If a shift would push past the extremes, no shift happens and the player marks a condition instead.
    

### 4. Influence

*   **Influence** represents how much a character cares about someone else’s opinion.
    
*   Characters must track who holds Influence over them and over whom they have Influence.
    
*   **Gaining Influence** allows someone to shift the target’s Labels (following the fiction).
    
*   Influence can be used or given up to push narrative changes (e.g., take an extra +1, inflict a condition).
    

### 5. Conditions

When things go wrong, characters mark conditions—negative emotional states that hinder performance:

*   **Afraid**: –2 to directly engage a threat
    
*   **Angry**: –2 to comfort/support or pierce the mask
    
*   **Guilty**: –2 to provoke or assess
    
*   **Hopeless**: –2 to unleash powers
    
*   **Insecure**: –2 to defend or reject others’ Influence
    

Characters clear conditions through specific actions (e.g., venting anger, acting to absolve guilt, or through specific moves).

### 6. Team & Team Pool

*   **Team Pool** is a collective resource used to enhance rolls or aid teammates in combat.
    
*   Team points are gained at the start of battle (and via moves) and spent to give +1 to a teammate’s roll or to act selfishly to raise your own Label temporarily.
    
*   Scenes start with 1 team by default or more if entering battle with a dangerous foe as a team.
    

### 7. Moment of Truth

Each playbook has a “Moment of Truth” (unlocked via advancement). In this dramatic scene, players get full narrative control to show off why their character embodies their archetype and to change the story fundamentally. After, one Label locks permanently, reflecting the character’s epiphany.

### 8. Advancement & Growth

Characters mark potential on misses. After five misses, they earn an “advancement” (new move, Label shift, or unlocking their Moment of Truth). After five core advancements, characters can take adult moves, switch playbooks, or retire.

## Playbooks (Character Archetypes)


Each playbook provides:

*   A narrative archetype,
    
*   A set of abilities/powers,
    
*   Unique moves, extras, and backstory questions,
    
*   A specific relationship prompt (“When our team first came together...”),
    
*   Influence assignment rules.
    

**The core playbooks include:**

1.  **Beacon**: A hopeful, “ordinary” hero who compensates with gadgetry or minor powers; focused on drives (small personal goals) and proving they belong on the team.
    
2.  **Bull**: A tough, super-strong brawler created (or forged) for violence. Central moves focus on love, rivalry, and roles like Defender, Friend, Listener, or Enabler.
    
3.  **Delinquent**: A rebellious troublemaker using tricks, deception, and provoking to push boundaries. Emphasizes conflict with authority and challenging convention.
    
4.  **Doomed**: A powerful hero with a tragic fate (doom), tracked via a doom track and doomsigns. They wrestle with power’s cost, their nemesis, and their ultimate demise.
    
5.  **Janus**: A masked hero balancing normal life and superhero identity. Handles secret identities, obligations, and shifting between mundane and superheroic roles.
    
6.  **Legacy**: A member of a long line of heroes bound by tradition and duty. They’re judged by predecessors and must either uphold or redefine their heritage.
    
7.  **Nova**: The powerhouse struggling to control vast energy. Uses flares and Burn to do large-scale magic/science feats but risks collateral damage and loss of control.
    
8.  **Outsider**: An alien or otherworldly being trying to fit into Earth’s society. Uses advanced technology, culture clashes, and a strong sense of belonging.
    
9.  **Protégé**: The sidekick or trainee of an established hero, wrestling with following their mentor’s path or forging their own. Handles guidance, rebellion, and legacy.
    
10.  **Transformed**: Once human, now monstrous in form; deals with prejudice, isolation, and finding acceptance or embracing monstrous power.

11. **Brain**: genius, inventions, shame

12.  **Harbinger**: time-traveler (added above)

13.  **Innocent**: past self vs. feared future self

14.  **Joined**: two PCs, bonds/distinctions, power together/apart

15.  **Newborn**: created being, lessons, regeneration/damaged

16.  **Nomad**: far-traveler, “Putting Down Roots” Influence rules

17.  **Reformed**: ex-villain, obligations, low places

18.  **Scion**: villain’s child, respect tracks & lineage pressure

19.  **Soldier**: A.E.G.I.S. operative, Soldier Label & orders

20.  **Star**: audience, PR, celebrity demands
    

## GM Guidance


### Key Principles for the GM:

*   **Describe Halcyon City like a comic**: evocative, visually rich, and mindful of pacing.
    
*   **Always address the heroes**: Keep focus on characters, their feelings, and their choices.
    
*   **Make moves but misdirect**: Don’t telegraph game mechanics—embed them in fictional description.
    
*   **Make threats real**: Show stakes—endanger innocents, highlight collateral costs, and enforce outcomes.
    
*   **Offer chances for failure**: Let villains escape, give heroes tough choices, and create lasting repercussions.
    
*   **Push Labels and Influence**: NPCs (especially adults) use Influence to shift Labels or force players to consider/reject advice.
    
*   **Support conditionally**: Adults offer help with strings attached; PCs must accept or push back.
    
*   **Draw on generational history**: Halcyon City has four generations of heroes; bring in mentors, past mistakes, legacies, and evolving ideals.
    
*   **Think in “gutters” between panels**: The world moves between scenes; keep track of unseen villain actions, evolving threats, and results of missed moves.
    
*   **Ask provocative questions**: Encourage players to expand the world—backstory details, relationships, or philosophical quandaries.
    
*   **Be a fan of the PCs**: Give them opportunities to shine, but also challenge them to grow and change.
    

### Villains & Threats:

*   Each villain has a drive (motivation), moves, and conditions (as NPC equivalents to PCs’ conditions). Villains mark a condition on each hit and respond immediately with more aggressive moves.
    

### Hooks & Arcs:

*   To structure longer campaigns, the GM builds “hooks” (pairs of NPCs who pull a PC’s Labels in opposite directions) and “arcs” (multi-phase stories—corruption, invasion, restriction, destruction, restoration) that allow campaigns to evolve.
    

### Custom Moves & Spin-offs:

*   The GM can create custom moves for special situations, environment hazards, or evolving powers. Moves should trigger on interesting and uncertain situations and deliver results that push the fiction forward.
    
*   Spin-off rules allow major system overhauls (e.g., changing how Influence works, adding harm/injury mechanics). Use carefully to ensure tone remains consistent.

## List of GM Moves

Here are the **standard GM moves in MASKS** and quick, practical ways to **bake each one directly into a villain move’s text**—so when you fire the villain move, you’re also cleanly making a GM move.

> **How to write them:**
> *Villain does a clear fiction-first thing → you present a cost/choice/consequence → you tag the mechanical effect (conditions, Influence, Team, etc.).*
> (Use “soft” phrasing when you’re setting up danger or a choice; use “hard” phrasing when you’re cashing it in.)

---

## The GM Moves (with villain‑text examples)

### 1) **Make a Villain Move**

**What it is:** Use one of the custom moves on that specific villain’s sheet.
**Write it like:** *“When [villain] does X, [fiction happens]. PCs must [choice] or [effect].”*
**Example:** “**Cut!** He points at the last hero action that changed something. **Choice**: keep it but **mark 2 conditions**, or redo it at **–2** under reshoot pressure.” (This is how *The Director* bakes GM pressure directly into his villain text.) 

---

### 2) **Make a Playbook Move**

**What it is:** Trigger a relevant adult/organization/NPC playbook move.
**Write it like:** *“Invoke [organization/adult move] to [tilt the scene]. On a hit, [spotlight shifts/effect].”*
**Example:** “A.E.G.I.S. deploys a **protocol move** that locks down the block; anyone who presses through acts **under scrutiny (–1 to the next relevant result)**.”

(*The Director* lists “Make a Playbook Move” right on his card to remind you this is always on the table.) 

---

### 3) **Activate the Downsides of their Abilities and Relationships**

**What it is:** Spotlight a teen’s complications, entanglements, or move downsides.
**Write it like:** *“Your power/relationship backfires; to push through, mark a condition or accept [new complication].”*
**Example:** “The EMP spikes your suit’s failsafe—**mark Insecure** or your armor **cuts out** for a panel.”

(*The Director*’s kit explicitly includes this GM move.) 

---

### 4) **Inflict a Condition**

**What it is:** Your primary “damage.”
**Write it like:** *“X hits home; choose **[Condition]** (or GM picks) unless you [costly mitigation].”*
**Example:** “The crowd’s jeers sting—**mark Insecure** unless you open up honestly in front of them.” (See also how *Fiddle Fiends* force **Insecure** and **Afraid/Hopeless** via crowd pressure.) 
*(Conditions are core to basic moves like **Take a Powerful Blow**, and to **Influence**—that’s why inflicting/clearing them is so potent.)* 

---

### 5) **Take Influence over Someone**

**What it is:** Adults and social threats assert narrative power over a teen’s self‑image.
**Write it like:** *“If you bite on their frame, they **gain Influence**; if you defy it, **mark a condition** or face [cost].”*
**Example:** “**Per My Last Email…** Sharon reframes your actions as policy violations—**she takes Influence** unless you accept a penalty (**–1 on the next result**) or **mark a fitting Condition**.” (*Sharon from HR*) 
*(See the Influence rules for how that leverage plays out.)* 

---

### 6) **Bring Them Together**

**What it is:** Push teamwork, shared purpose, and Team economy.
**Write it like:** *“If you coordinate, **+1 Team** or gain an opening; if you don’t, escalate [threat/effect].”*
**Example:** “Choreo the defense as a **duet**; on a clear signal, **add 1 Team**. If you grandstand alone, the hazard spreads to bystanders.” (*Pairs neatly with Enter Battle as a Team.*) 

---

### 7) **Capture Someone**

**What it is:** Separate/secure a target.
**Write it like:** *“They isolate a hero; accept a **compromise** to stay free or you’re **captured**.”*
**Example:** “**Mandatory 1:1.** Sharon peels you into a ‘quick chat’—go now and **lose time/reputation**, or **security escorts you out** (you’re effectively **captured**).” 

---

### 8) **Put Innocents in Danger**

**What it is:** Classic superhero pressure.
**Write it like:** *“X endangers civilians; if you don’t split attention to save them, [consequence/Condition].”*
**Example:** “**Stampede.** The fan swarm breaks into dangerous currents through traffic—**civilians are in peril** unless someone pivots to rescue.” (*Fiddle Fiends*) 

---

### 9) **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage**

**What it is:** Make the fallout vivid and mechanical.
**Write it like:** *“Your big swing cracks the support; either **mark Guilty** or **spend Team** to shore it up.”*
**Example:** “The stage rigging buckles. Keep pressing and **mark Guilty**, or burn **1 Team** to stabilize it on the fly.” (*Explicitly listed on The Director*) 

---

### 10) **Reveal the Future**

**What it is:** Foreshadow clocks, moves, or next issue’s threat.
**Write it like:** *“A teaser panel lands: unless you do X soon, expect Y next scene.”*
**Example:** “A push alert: *‘A.E.G.I.S. vote in 10 minutes.’* If you don’t sway it, **adult oversight** lands next scene with stricter rules.”

---

### 11) **Announce Between‑Panel Threats**

**What it is:** Advance off‑screen danger or call in reinforcements.
**Write it like:** *“While you’re busy, [new element] is already in motion.”*
**Example:** “**And… action!** All other enemies who haven’t acted take **an extra villain move now**—the set explodes with activity.” (*The Director*) 

---

### 12) **Make Them Pay a Price for Victory**

**What it is:** They can win, but it costs.
**Write it like:** *“You can have it if you accept [cost: conditions, split, lost asset].”*
**Example:** “Slam the vault shut and you’ll **seal the bomb inside**—but **mark Hopeless** from the weight of that choice.”
(*See The Director’s **Cut!**—keep the win but **mark 2 conditions**, or retake under pressure.*) 

---

### 13) **Turn Their Move Back on Them**

**What it is:** Mirror their tactic; twist the knife.
**Write it like:** *“That clever gambit rebounds; suffer [mirrored effect] unless you change approach.”*
**Example:** “Your sonic burst feeds the villain’s **resonance cage**—either **mark Afraid** and drop it, or they trap an ally inside.”

(*Explicitly present in The Director’s move list: Counter/Reverse.*) 

---

### 14) **Tell Them the Possible Consequences—and Ask**

**What it is:** Offer informed choice; keep agency front‑and‑center.
**Write it like:** *“If you do it this way, here’s what’ll happen—do you proceed?”*
**Example:** “Break the non‑compete and **legal comes down** on your mentor; do you go through with it?”
(*Sharon’s ‘Per My Last Email…’ is a great example of reframing and presenting costs up front.*) 

---

### 15) **Tell Them Who They Are or Who They Should Be**

**What it is:** Adults/antagonists press Labels and identity.
**Write it like:** *“They define you; if you accept, shift Labels their way; if you reject, roll to resist and face fallout.”*
**Example:** “*‘You’re just a PR product.’* Accept it to shift toward **Superior**, or reject and risk **Insecure** in front of the cameras.”
*(Ties directly into **Influence** and **Rejecting Influence**.)* 

---

### 16) **Bring an NPC to Rash Decisions and Hard Conclusions**

**What it is:** NPCs escalate fast—panic, betray, strike.
**Write it like:** *“X snaps; unless you intervene, they do Y immediately.”*
**Example:** “The venue manager **pulls the fire alarm**; if you don’t calm them now, **everyone evacuates** and the villain slips away.”
(*The Director* names this explicitly—great for speeding a scene to consequence.) 

---

## Quick templates you can paste into a villain sheet

* **[GM: Inflict a Condition]** “Their [attack/words] land. **Mark [Condition]**, or [costly mitigation].”
* **[GM: Take Influence]** “If you accept their framing, they **take Influence**; if you refuse, **mark [Condition]** or suffer [penalty].”
* **[GM: Put Innocents in Danger]** “X endangers bystanders; if you don’t split to help, [escalate/cost].”
* **[GM: Price for Victory]** “You can have it **if** you accept [loss/Condition/Team –1].”
* **[GM: Consequences & Ask]** “If you do it this way, [bad thing] happens—do you proceed?”

> **See it in action:**
> • *Fiddle Fiends* (crowd hazard) uses **Put Innocents in Danger** and **Inflict Conditions** (“Stampede,” “Mosh Pit,” “Seek Validation”). 
> • *Sharon from HR* (bureaucratic/social) shows **Take Influence**, **Capture Someone**, and **Consequences & Ask** (“Per My Last Email…,” “Mandatory 1:1,” “Performance Improvement Plan”). 
> • *The Director* (meta‑producer) literally lists the GM move set and implements **Price for Victory**, **Between‑Panel Threats**, etc. (“Cut!,” “And… action!”). 

---

### Design tips (fast)

* **Name the feeling** in your villain move title (“Fan Fury,” “Safety First”) and **tag the GM move** in the body—this keeps fiction foremost and mechanics transparent. (You can also mirror what’s in your players’ basic moves and Influence rules so consequences feel integrated.) 
* **Soft first, hard later.** Offer a choice or foreshadow (soft), then cash it in with conditions, capture, or collateral (hard).
* **Aim moves at identity.** MASKS sings when GM moves threaten Labels/Influence as much as bodies and buildings.


### GM Advice
## BEHIND THE MASKS
The playbooks your players choose tell you more than just their specific abilities and moves—they tell you the issues and themes your players are interested in seeing during the game.
Pay close attention to the contents of this section: the playbook moves. Each playbook comes with a few GM moves, catered to that playbook’s specific issues and elements. Use these moves when you could make any other move to drive attention to those thematic pieces of each character.

## THE BEACON
• Draw attention to their inadequacies
• Praise their best traits
• Make them pay for their audacity
• Compare them to the others
• Play to their drives
The Beacon is “normal,” through and through, and there’s a strong argument to be made they shouldn’t be with this team—and it’s your job, as GM, to make that argument. Put pressure on the Beacon to prove why they belong. Doubt them. Make them insecure. And then give them chances to shine, doing whatever it is they do best. Pay attention to the Beacon’s drives— those tell you what the Beacon is hoping to do, and you should try your best to help the Beacon mark them off, at least one per session.

## THE BULL
The Bull is hyperfocused on their love and rival, by default. Go with that. Play up those relationships. Make their love endangered, and their rival bolstered, to give them chances to react. Sometimes, flip it to keep things interesting—endanger their rival and bolster their love (maybe with a competing love interest).
The Bull comes from some dark past, some weapons program, something that made them so destructive. Bring that up, and don’t ever let them totally forget what they are, especially by using villains and other enemies just like them, or by swarming them with mundane forces to watch them prove what a weapon they are when they overcome.

• Endanger their love
• Bolster their rival
• Reveal dark secrets of their past
• Attack with someone just like them
• Swarm with mundane forces
193

## THE DELINQUENT
• Put them in chains
• Give or take an audience
• Give them conditional love
• Show them the line
• Offer a helping hand
The Delinquent is likely to be a rebel without a cause as well as a performer looking for an audience. They’re cynical and sarcastic, yet desirous of honest, naïvely positive relationships. Play to all sides of their character. Restrict them with rules so they can break free, but also offer them support and help tie them up with relationships too.
Sometimes, put them in front of an audience of watchers who love their antics; other times, take away that audience and leave them cold and alone. Give them love, but only by attaching a price to it, and never let them forget that there are powers above them setting the rules and boundaries.

## THE DOOMED
The Doomed is fatalistic and grim. Adding a Doomed to your game inherently puts death on the table, and makes your entire game a bit darker. Don’t ever let them forget that they’re doomed. Have other characters reference it, add bits of description about it to the fiction, and make them mark their doom track.
For the doomsign Infinite Powers, make sure they know they can take an ability from another playbook for a one-time action—not a move from another playbook.
Talk to them to make sure you have a joint understanding of what the triggers that advance their doom track look like. And don’t worry about giving them a final confrontation with their doom. If it makes sense in the fiction, give them the opportunity to overcome it, but they’ll have to contend with their doom, one way or another, thanks to their advances.
• Mark their doom track
• Offer a chance to further their cause
• Remind them of what they could lose
• Push them to the brink
• Offer temporary relief with a cost
194

## THE JANUS
• Bring their obligations to bear
• Endanger someone from either life
• Make their lives cross over
• Put more obligations on them
• Take away their mask
The Janus is about the nature of having two identities. Push them on it. You’re in charge of saying when time passes, so you’re in charge of making the Janus roll for their social obligations—don’t skimp. Continually ask them which life they’re in. If someone doesn’t know the identity they’re currently in, ask the Janus if the Influence they hold over that person would really apply.
Make both lives tough. Their superheroic life is obviously difficult, because the team as a whole will be mixed up in crazy drama. But they need specific pushing from their mundane life and the obligations therein. Have those in their mundane life lay obligations upon them. Put the people in their mundane life in danger as much as those in their superheroic life.
Give the people in their mundane life opinions on the people in their superheroic life, then make them all interact. And when they’re at the mercy of dangerous foes, or the situation warrants...unmask them.

## THE LEGACY
Every PC will be compared to the older generation to some extent, but the Legacy has direct predecessors, alongside rules and traditions they’ve sworn to uphold. Make those prior heroes matter more by talking about them often and having them show up at the worst possible times.
Diversify the meaning of their legacy—what it means to prior members may not be the same as what it means to the public. Constantly compare the Legacy to their predecessors. Give them further duties, and missions directly from their own legacy, like catching or defeating their legacy’s famous villains.
Sometimes, sit them down for a talk with members of their legacy to discuss their recent performance—and don’t let them off the hook. Remember that you’re ultimately responsible for making the move for the legacy trigger, to see how members of the legacy respond to the PC’s recent actions; don’t let that slide for too long.
• Remind them of their traditions
• Compare them to the past
• Make them answer their family’s concerns
• Raise expectations on them
• Honor them

## THE NOVA
• Remind them of past collateral damage
• Reveal a terrible truth of their powers
• Make their powers flare out of control
• Stoke their conditions
• Introduce threats only they can tackle
The Nova is pure power, and they’re likely to think they can handle nearly any threat—what’s more, they’re probably right. But they can’t do it without paying a high price, and that price drives the playbook. Having a Nova at your table should amp up the power level of the threats the heroes deal with.
Never let the Nova forget the damage they’ve caused. Have people hold grudges or explain why they’re worried about the Nova’s self control. Sometimes, cause the Nova’s powers to flare out of control.
The Nova’s heavily tied up in their own head—play with that. Show them that their powers are truly dangerous, or come from an insidious source, or have an inherent cost, and let them deal with that terrible truth. Play to their conditions, their anger or their fear or their insecurity, and harp on them, while giving them opportunities to take action to clear those conditions.

## THE OUTSIDER
• Draw attention to their differences
• Make a request from home
• Introduce a monitor from home
• Accept and support them in their moments of weakness
• Provoke their beliefs and practices in tense situations
The Outsider is a stranger who wants to fit in. Don’t let them forget the struggle. Call out how they look, act, and think differently. Give them reasons to stay—show them the best parts of Earth, and accept them when they’re low.
But make them decide if they really want to commit to this strange place. And never let them totally forget their home. Even if they don’t think they have direct contact to their home, send them missives from where they come from, making myriad requests. Introduce characters from their home.
Having an Outsider at your table means you should introduce other aliens and cultures. Play up other outsider groups. Make Halcyon City, and the universe, full of strange, wonderful, and terrible people.
196

## THE PROTÉGÉ
• Convey their mistakes
• Bestow wisdom, wanted or unwanted
• Hold up a mirror to them
• Give them exactly what
they need at a cost
• Endanger their mentor
The Protégé is about their relationship with their mentor—so you have to
make that mentor show up a lot. Chances are good that the mentor will have opinions of everyone on the team, not just the Protégé.
The mentor is here to teach the Protégé, so they should always be telling the Protégé what the PC has done wrong. They don’t have to be mean about it, but it should drive the Protégé up the wall a bit. The mentor can provide the team with great resources and information, too—but always at a price, most often that the team follow the mentor’s rules.
Make the mentor awesome, too—someone the Protégé might genuinely want to be. At the same time, show the costs of the life that the mentor leads.. And sometimes, put their mentor in danger, with the only salvation coming from the Protégé themselves. Give the Protégé the chance to show their mentor
everything they’ve learned.

## THE TRANSFORMED
• Reject them
• Show how they are feared or hated
• Attack them with unthinking hordes
• Remind them of what they’ve lost
• See their true self
The Transformed looks different, can’t hide it, and feels insecure about it.
They bring into play issues of being different and wanting to fit in, but from a different perspective to the Outsider. The Outsider might be able to teach Earth something—there might be a compromise. The Transformed, though, used to be normal...and never will be again.
Reject the Transformed and show the negative reactions their form provokes. People fear and hate them for how they look, and their struggle is about overcoming those perspectives; so provide plenty of rejection. Show them the things they’ve lost and can’t do anymore.
Sometimes, though, give them a reprieve. Don’t do it too often, but have NPCs see through their visage to the real person beneath. Sympathize with their pain and support them.


## THE BRAIN
GM ADVICE
Confront them with their Shame
• Complicate their solution or gadget
• Present an impossible problem to solve
• Judge them for their overconfidence
• Show them how they need others
The Brain is built upon a fundamental dichotomy—that they can solve nearly any problem with their incredible intellect, and that only caring about “solving a problem” will always lead to new consequences and problems.
Play into the Brain’s tendency to rely on their genius intellect as the Swiss army knife solution to all problems. If they jump in and try to create brand new solutions, let them—and then show them the hidden or unforeseen costs and consequences of those decisions. If they think they can handle an entire villain all by themselves, show them how they can only do so much without help. Don’t try to take away the Brain’s incredible abilities and problem-solving capacity—that’s taking away what makes the Brain cool. Instead, let them try to solve problems, and then complicate the results.
And the most direct tool in your toolbox for doing this is the Brain’s Shame. No matter what it is, it will always come back, and it will always complicate their life. Never let them get out from under the guilt, and do your best to connect their Shame to new and different problems. Their Shame is definitively the one problem they will never be able to solve—until they take that advancement and change playbooks.

## The Soldier
GM ADVICE
The Soldier is a bit like a supercharged version of the Legacy or the Protégé in terms of GM responsibilities. You are in charge of bringing a whole organization to life. You need to give the Soldier missions, supply them, and judge them.
Play up A.E.G.I.S.’s complicated nature at all times, and never let the Soldier or the other PCs forget it exists. When they’re about to go into battle, A.E.G.I.S. contacts the Soldier with new objectives—and always active objectives, never “do nothing” or “sit tight.” When the PCs are in dire straits, A.E.G.I.S. shows up to bail them out. And when the Soldier counts on A.E.G.I.S., they discover some evidence of corruption that resets their relationship all over again.
The Soldier’s relationship with A.E.G.I.S. is founded on tragedy—all Soldiers earned their abilities through a disaster or tragedy, and then were inspired to join A.E.G.I.S. That relationship defines the kind of emotional support that A.E.G.I.S. supplies the Soldier, as opposed to that of a mentor or legacy. A.E.G.I.S. gives the Soldier direction, focus, and resources to pursue goals, and then expects the Soldier to fulfill their duties. Many individuals in A.E.G.I.S. (particularly higher-ups) are going to try to keep the relationship just in that form, with a highly devoted Soldier rooted in tragedy, and a detached agency providing support through direction.

## The Harbinger
GM ADvice
• Center a plot around their “remembered” characters
• Undermine what they think they know
• Reveal clear future paths
• Evoke the pleasures of the present
• Show the timeline ripples of their actions
The Harbinger makes “the future” a tangible thing in your game. As GM, you are responsible for juggling the idea of causality changes, predestination paradoxes, and multiple timelines. Essentially, you must account for the time- travel nonsense the Harbinger brings to the game so as to amp up the drama and difficult choices. They’re not in charge of making sure the timelines make sense (or at least, comic-book sense); you are, and your goal in doing so is to ensure the different timelines and ripple effects and future selves contribute to interesting and cool stories without being too confusing.
This playbook needs major figures who play roles in both the present and the future to function, and its Connect the dots section is designed to foster just that. The player is responsible for trying to fill those names in by triggering the attached move. When a player does trigger the move, they’re signaling that they are interested in this character, so keep that in mind when deciding your portion of the move. Deciding on a miss that the future has no record of the character could write them off in some cases...but it could raise interesting questions in others. Why wouldn’t the future have any records of Champion, one of the greatest heroes of Halcyon City?
Because of the way that move works, at the beginning of the game, you are most likely to have significant say over the role those characters play in the future. As time goes on, the player will have more and more say, but fewer and fewer roles to choose from along with a clearer picture of the future. But ultimate responsibility for making sure that everything fits together into a coherent picture of the future lies with you. And for the most part, all the choices and the information you reveal need to build on each other—until the Harbinger uses their Moment of Truth, and resets everything.

## The Nomad
The Nomad is a character defined by a desire to wander and be detached— to be free from the ties that bind. It’s your job as GM to make sure that the Nomad’s desire is complicated, foiled, and countered.
The extent to which the Nomad is tied into the world around them is (somewhat) measurable, by how much Influence the Nomad has actually given out. If the Nomad has given out 0-Influence, then they are ready to run—but if they have given out 6-Influence, then they’re heavily tied into the world.
As GM, introduce characters who are interested in the Nomad, who want to have Influence over them, and who go about pursuing that Influence through myriad means, whether by impressing the Nomad or fostering them or even overpowering them. You have no control over whether these characters actually gain Influence over the Nomad—it’s all in the player’s hands—so all you can do is present interesting and complicated options to the player.
As the Nomad does give out Influence, those relationships become the most important to threaten and stress. Keep those relationships in mind for hard moves and interesting complications.
The Nomad also gives you great license to really go gonzo with the fiction around them. They’re an interdimensional/galactic/temporal traveler—and the issues they bring with them can range the full spectrum of those madcap settings. Have fun with it!
GM ADVICE
• Introduce bizarre elements from their adventures
• Offer them solace, comfort, and the feeling of home
• Threaten what anchors they have
• Restrain and confine them
• Show them how little they really know

## The Scion

GM ADVICE
Unlike most other playbooks in MASKS, the Scion isn’t just trying to determine their own fate in contrast to the wishes and Influence of others; the Scion is trying to earn the respect of specific individuals by taking Influence over them. For most other MASKS characters, earning Influence over an adult is a nice benny. For the Scion, it’s the whole game.
The Scion has multiple ways to gain Influence, including White lies and I’ll show them, in addition to using the “How could I gain Influence over you?” option of piercing someone’s mask. But as the GM, you should feel comfortable awarding them Influence when they’ve earned it in the fiction—especially in the form of respect. Once the Scion has named a character in their Respect section, they can’t really earn “Influence” over that character; they can only mark the next box on the Respect track. So think about what that character would actually respect, and when the Scion acts that way, grant them Influence, thereby letting them mark the next box on the track. You can even make the demands explicit, i.e. “I’ll see you as your own person when you start acting the way I want.”
Consider the options the Scion chose for their lineage when deciding how to use their supervillain parent. If they chose that their parent is a master thief, then their parent is almost certainly more innocuous than a grandiose tyrant or fearsome destroyer. If they chose that their relationship is “mostly strangers,” then they barely know their parent, and are either interested in changing that, or okay with how things are. Only when the Scion has chosen particular options should you consider making their parent a consistent, “main” character of the game. Otherwise, having their parent show up periodically in person, but mostly through reputation and their deeds elsewhere, is the right way to go.
• Blame them for their parent’s deeds
• Grant them respect
• Make demands on them
• Interrogate their reasons or deeds
• Introduce characters tied to their parent


## The INNOCENT GM ADVICE
• Confront them with their future self
• Mirror the steps on their future self ’s path
• Show them an absurdity of the present (their future)
• Show them an artifact of the past (their present)
• Judge them by their future self ’s standard
The Innocent is a simultaneously hopeful and dark hero. They are, themselves, hopeful and light, but they are on a path to becoming something much more dangerous, and the drama of the playbook comes from toying with that path. Give the Innocent plenty of reasons and opportunities to venture down that path. Don’t let their life be easy, and don’t ever let them forget the other person that people see when they look at the Innocent.
Introducing the Innocent into your game immediately creates an important figure in your Halcyon City setting—the Innocent’s future self. They need to be someone all of the other characters would recognize and fear. Make sure to integrate the future self into the setting through your questions. Don’t let their future self ever appear definitively to be a villain. It’s your job to play on their choices and make sure their future self really seems sympathetic, like a future version of them who’s been through hell.

## JOINED GM ADVICE
• Offer them, and them alone, opportunities for success or fun
• Flaunt the abilities and successes of their other half in front of them
• Mistake them and their other half for being each other, or a single entity
• Express interest in them, and them alone
• Separate them
The Joined is an advanced playbook, and as soon as two players agree to play with it, they’re taking on a higher burden than a normal Masks playbook. They’re agreeing to have their stories deeply entwined, to share a lot of the cool bits of their playbooks, and to bounce off each other for the rest of the story. That can be absolutely amazing, but they will need your help to make it come together.
In general, use the Joined only when you have 4 or more PCs. That way, you’ll have at least two other PCs outside of the Joined’s core connection. Any fewer, and the game becomes less about the team and more about the Joined.
Keep an eye out for the Joined and their other half becoming too wrapped up in their own world. If the Joined and their other half are barely interacting with any other PCs at all, then there’s a problem. Put them in situations where they’re forced to act as individuals, with the other PCs around.
Use your NPCs to simultaneously divide them and force them together. Push in the opposite of whichever direction they’re already tending. If they’re coming together, separate them by having an NPC offer an opportunity to only the Joined and not their other half. If they’re separate from each other, smoosh them together by having a major hero think of them only as a single unit, or mistake them for each other.
Your job when dealing with the Joined is to make the rest of the world intrudes on their relationship. Chances are, the two players involved will already be interested in the drama and stakes of the relationship. You need to make sure neither one forgets that the rest of the world has thoughts about their relationship, as well.

## NEWBORN GM ADVICE
• Teach them a new lesson
• Correct an existing lesson
• Push one of their lessons to the brink
• Remind them of their fundamental inhumanity
• Exert ownership or control over them as a piece of property
The Newborn is a strangely fluid playbook that makes explicit what is implicit in many of the others. For the Newborn, moral lessons are hard-coded, written down on the character sheet, and thereby granted all the more meaning and importance. The player is the most involved with those lessons—monitoring them, watching them, and calling out when they come into play—but that doesn’t mean you can ignore them. Pay attention to those lessons as best you can, especially any time the Newborn writes a new one or changes an existing lesson. Those are important moments that tell you a lot about where the character is going...and where to press them dramatically.
Also, you are the final arbiter of whether or not the Newborn embodies lessons, but that doesn’t mean you should be stingy. Give them credit where it is due.
A great way to use NPCs around the Newborn is to teach them lessons, whether by outright trying to communicate a new principle or arguing with an existing principle. You can be very explicit with NPCs trying to teach the Newborn lessons, especially if they know the Newborn’s true nature—the creator of an android is absolutely going to try to teach the android in a straightforward fashion.
Finally, the Newborn is a surprisingly durable playbook, where conditions matter a great deal. Push them a lot. Make them mark conditions, especially if they’ve taken Damage or Regeneration. Those moves signs that the Newborn wants to be punched. So don’t back off.

## REFORMED GM ADVICE
• Remind them of what they’ve done
• Ask them for a criminal or villainous favor
• Doubt them from a position of moral superiority
• Offer them solace with a criminal or villainous source
• Confront them with a nightmare from their past
Introducing the Reformed provides a through-line into the villainous side of Halcyon City. The Reformed was once important in that scene and still has plenty of contacts in that world. That means it’s more important than ever for you to portray the villains as full humans, with sympathetic drives and believable personas. The empathy that the Reformed demands makes it tough to also have ridiculous, grandstanding, unsympathetic villains at the same time.
In addition to the increased focus on villains and sympathetic criminals, the Reformed also adds another element to Masks that no other playbook focuses on as clearly—the past. Even though the Reformed is young, they’ve been in the superhero scene for a while, and they’ve taken many actions in that time. The past of the Reformed is very important for their present, and as a result the Reformed requires you to spend more time asking questions and talking about the past than any other playbook. Don’t hesitate to ask questions about what’s happened if it ever becomes important to what’s going on in the present.

## STAR GM ADVICE
• Reinterpret their actions in the media
• Make a demand from their audience
• Offer an opportunity for public attention
• Offer an opportunity for quiet heroism
• Demean their superficiality
The Star introduces the need for media attention and public responses into Masks. Their audience and celebrity affords the Star some excellent advantages and opportunities, but also puts on them enormous pressure, and provides a clearer source of constant judgment than any other character might have. Don’t let up. If the Star wants to call for a public appearance, or if the Star wants to get any kind of attention, they should be able to without any difficulty...but if they ever try to escape the limelight, it should only ever be a temporary reprieve. The demands of the audience always give you an excuse to make them intrude and let the Star know what they think.
On the same note, the offers, opportunities, temptations, and difficult decisions offered to the Star need to almost always be oriented toward popularity and celebrity. The Star’s drama isn’t served by offers of terrible power or by incredibly difficult moral decisions, but by seemingly innocuous choices between popularity and justice. Taking credit for a friend’s good deeds; showing a hard line response to a villain you might actually want to give mercy; focusing on the more publicly disliked threat than the actual threat—these are the decisions the Star’s story is made of. Throw them at the Star so they have to deal with the costs of their own celebrity.
