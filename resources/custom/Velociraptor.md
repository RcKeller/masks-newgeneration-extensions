## FERAL VELOCIRAPTOR

**Summons & visage.** From a jag of shattered glass and ivy cracks, a whip‑thin raptor slides into the frame—sickle‑claws raised, feathers bristling like a punk crest, pupils razor‑thin. It *listens* to the heroes’ breath, then moves before anyone finishes their thought.

**How it fights.** **Ambush and reposition.** It herds targets into a **kill box**—between dumpsters, into scaffolding, under signage—then darts in with hamstring slashes and pounces. When its talons land, **Inflict a Condition** or call **Take a Powerful Blow**; when it weaponizes the space, **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage** (skewered signage, falling tile).  

**Turtle Tamer synergy.** The Tamer’s **shell wards** can bank one “too‑fast” strike per round, **turning the move back on the attacker** as the raptor ricochets past and claws into scenery—now a hazard the team must manage. 

**Run notes.** Treat the environment as a third combatant. Use **Between‑Panel Threats** to seed “second raptor silhouettes” or shifting shadows—whether or not there’s actually a pack. Keep the camera *tight, low, and fast*. 

**Condition moves (5):**

* **Afraid — Brush Cover [GM: Hide/Block].** It **vanishes** into clutter, spilling crates and banners behind—**obscuring lanes**. Chase (and **mark Afraid**) or let it **reframe** the kill box. 
* **Angry — Pack Screech [GM: Escalate/Between‑Panels].** A piercing cry; **new hazards** (falling signage, spooked dogs, drone cams) **arrive now** while you’re busy.  
* **Guilty — Worthy Prey [GM: Seek Forgiveness/Influence].** It hesitates over a terrified civilian and **backs off**. If a hero claims the opening with compassion, **clear 1 of its conditions** and let them **exercise Influence** immediately; if spurned, **inflict Guilty** on an onlooker. 
* **Hopeless — Flight or Bite [GM: Exit].** Unless opposed immediately, it **bolts** off‑panel; if intercepted, it stays but **marks a condition**. 
* **Insecure — Reset the Kill Box [GM: Reintroduce Hazard].** Overcompensating, it **re‑arms** a cleared trap/hazard (collapsed ladder, loose scaffolding, alarmed doors); returning mooks come back with **3 conditions marked**. 

**Villain moves (3–5):**

* **Pounce [GM: Capture Someone].** It pins a hero; escape by **marking a condition** or surrendering your position/weapon.
* **Hamstring [GM: Inflict a Condition].** A precise slash: **mark Afraid or Insecure**, or your speed/mobility is **compromised** for a panel while you regroup. 
* **Thicket Maze [GM: Put Innocents in Danger].** It **drives** pedestrians into oncoming traffic/locked doors; peel off to rescue or **accept fallout** (someone marks a condition). 
* **“Clever Girl” [GM: Turn Their Move Back].** Mirror a hero’s tactic back at them—grapples become throws; nets become snares. **Suffer the mirrored effect** unless you **change approach**. 
* **Kill Box Setup [GM: Announce Between‑Panel Threats].** While you tangle, **two new angles** of attack set up off‑panel—expect the follow‑through next panel.
