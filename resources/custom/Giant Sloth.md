## GIANT SLOTH (“MOLASSES TITAN”)

**Summons & visage.** A hush falls; the air *feels heavier*. From a lamplit park, a moss‑draped mega‑sloth unfolds like a creaking drawbridge. Its black‑glass claws are curved scythes; its breath comes in foggy bells. The city seems to **slow** around it.

**How it fights.** Slow is not safe. Molasses Titan’s **lunges are sudden**, its weight unforgiving. Lean on **time pressure**: while it’s “slowly” toppling a bus, it’s also about to **crush** something you care about next panel. When its hook‑claw lands, **Inflict a Condition** or call **Take a Powerful Blow**; when it sinks onto load‑bearing structures, **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage** unless someone dives to prop or redirect.  

**Turtle Tamer synergy.** The Tamer’s **gravity‑slowing aura** pairs perfectly: until the team establishes a workaround/team rhythm, apply a **situational –1** to speed‑dependent approaches (once someone reframes, remove it). Advance any crowd/falling clocks during the lull. 

**Run notes.** Reward **team choreography**—duet grapples, leap‑frog props, synchronized pry‑bars—by adding **+1 Team** when they truly bring it together on‑panel. Conversely, if uncoordinated, **Put Innocents in Danger** as slow‑motion disasters compound. 

**Condition moves (5):**

* **Afraid — Tree Line [GM: Block/Split].** It climbs and **perches** on a facade, out of ground reach. Pursue in precarious verticals and **mark Afraid**, or let it **shift zones** to menace bystanders. 
* **Angry — Sudden Lunge [GM: Escalate].** A startling burst—**vents unthinking violence**, **smashes supports**, showers debris. If no one manages fallout, **inflict conditions** on two heroes in the blast. 
* **Guilty — Gentle Setdown [GM: Offer Opening/Influence].** It carefully **sets down** a threatened bus and *pauses*. If a hero meets that softness, **clear 1 of its conditions** and allow an **Influence** moment; if scorned, it **marks a condition** and returns meaner. 
* **Hopeless — Street‑Side Hibernate [GM: Exit Timer].** It **curls** mid‑avenue; unless moved or meaningfully engaged by next panel, its **mass locks the area**, and it starts **exiting the scene** into slumber. If stopped, it stays but **marks a condition**. 
* **Insecure — Do‑Over [GM: Reintroduce Hazard].** Overcompensating, it **re‑uses** a hazard (downed lines, fallen billboard, toppled crane) the team resolved; if that hazard had mooks, they return with **3 conditions marked**. 

**Villain moves (3–5):**

* **Bear Hug [GM: Capture Someone].** It **squeezes**; escape now by **marking a condition** or be **trapped** while oxygen fades.
* **Hook Swipe [GM: Inflict a Condition].** Bone‑deep rake: **mark Afraid/Angry** unless you concede position or **Take a Powerful Blow**. 
* **Gravity of Dread [GM: Bring Them Together/Reveal Future].** Until someone sets a **shared rhythm** or clever counter, **speed‑leaning basics take –1** and **danger clocks advance** (falling facade, crowd panic). 
* **Sagging Canopy [GM: Put Innocents in Danger].** Awnings/powerlines **bow** under its weight, **threatening a crowd**; peel off to help or the **PR blowback** lands as **Guilty**.
* **Slow‑Motion Disaster [GM: Tell Consequences & Ask].** “If you keep trading blows here, the **medical clinic** goes with it—do you proceed?”
