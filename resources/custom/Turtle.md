## TURTLE KAIJU

**Summons & visage.** The river heaves. A cathedral‑sized terrapin surfaces, algae‑draped and barnacle‑armored. Eyes like lanterns; a beak built to shear floodgates. Every step is a **mini‑quake**; the waterfront tilts into it like a supplicant.

**How it fights.** The Kaiju is a **moving disaster zone**—wave action, shellquakes, floating debris. Frame each action in **zones** (rooftops, seawall, flood street, barge tops). Use it to **drag the heroes’ attention across zones**, forcing them to **choose between rescue and offense**. When the beak closes or the tail sweeps, **Inflict a Condition** (Angry or Afraid are common) or call **Take a Powerful Blow**; when its mass hits structure, **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage**.  

**Turtle Tamer synergy.** While the Tamer channels **Patience of the Tortoise**, speed‑leaning approaches operate at a disadvantage until the team invents a rhythm; feel free to **advance clocks** for flooding/panic until the heroes reframe the fight. 

**Run notes.** Put **Innocents in Danger** relentlessly—tour boats, a trapped ferry, a cracked seawall. Offer openings if the team **Brings Them Together** (chain rescues; barge‑to‑barge hops). This is where MASKS sings: more than knock‑outs, you’re challenging duty vs. victory.  

**Condition moves (5):**

* **Afraid — Sounding Dive [GM: Split/Exit].** The terrapin **dives**; follow underwater (mark **Afraid** to brave the depths) or watch it **reposition off‑panel** toward softer targets upriver. 
* **Angry — Snap Judgment [GM: Collateral].** A furious stomp ripples a **shellquake** through pilings. **–1 Team** from the chaos. Target 1 hero: stand firm and **mark Angry**, or give ground and the Kaiju **breaks something important**. 
* **Guilty — Save the Hatchlings [GM: Offer Opening].** It rescues a real turtle clutch—or a civilian—creating a **clear opening**: the next action against it gets **+1 forward**. If a hero accepts its hesitation with empathy, **clear 1 of its conditions** and allow an **Influence** moment; if scorned, it **doubles down later**. 
* **Hopeless — Retreat to the Deeps [GM: Exit/Price].** Unless a hero **Directly Engages** by next panel, it **exits the scene** to open water. If caught, it stays but **marks a condition**. 
* **Insecure — Rebuild the Reef [GM: Reintroduce Hazard].** Overcompensating, it **re‑raises** a hazard (collapsed causeway, jammed drawbridge, floating container pile) the team already solved; if that hazard was a minion, it returns with **3 conditions marked**. 

**Villain moves (3–5):**

* **Shellquake [GM: Collateral].** A full‑body heave sends **shockwaves** through quay and street; either **mark Guilty** to keep swinging or spend **1 Team** to stabilize beams. 
* **Harbor Surge [GM: Put Innocents in Danger].** A tidal bore tears through slips and cafes; if no one pivots to rescue, **random heroes mark Afraid/Hopeless**. 
* **“Snap!” [GM: Capture Someone].** The beak clamps a hero or anchor cable; escape now by **marking a condition** or be **carried off** across zones. 
* **Carapace Ward [GM: Turn Their Move Back].** Brutal hits **glance**; redirect one big blow into **environmental fallout** (cracked pier). Then **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage**. 
* **Storm Wake [GM: Announce Between‑Panel Threats].** Sirens cut: barges loose, a barge‑crane tips… **new hazards are already in motion** while you’re busy elsewhere.
