## GIANT CLAWED BADGER (“RIPSNARL”)

**Summons & visage.** The Turtle Tamer slams a shell‑totem into the asphalt; the ground *hollows*, then ruptures as a locomotive‑sized badger shoulders up in a spray of gravel. Ripsnarl’s foreclaws are street‑sign long, built for tearing earth and steel alike. The mask of dirt around its eyes looks like war paint. It huffs once; storm drains rattle.

**How it fights.** Think **burrow, pop, maul, vanish**. It isolates a hero by tunneling under their feet, pops up with a sweeping claw, then drops away, leaving skewed footing, broken mains, and civilians in peril. Give the team hard location choices—down into the tunnels (tight quarters) or up top (collateral). To show **wounding potential**, when its claw connects, **Inflict a Condition** (often **Afraid** or **Angry**) or call for **Take a Powerful Blow**; describe bruising, torn costume, ringing ears—keep it PG‑13 but **make it feel like it hurts**. 

**Turtle Tamer synergy.** If the Tamer “shells up,” let Ripsnarl use that reprieve to **reposition** and re‑emerge where it splits the party. If the heroes brute‑force the shell, you’re perfectly within bounds to **Show the Costs of Collateral Damage** as girders twist and streetlights topple. 

**Run notes.** Burrow networks are a living hazard—mark a simple **3‑tick “Cave‑in” clock** that advances whenever heroes go loud underground or miss a roll; on completion, a **hard move**: collapse, trapped bystanders, or a separated PC. Keep moves **soft first** (rumble, cracks, warning dust) before cashing in with a hard cave‑in. 

**Condition moves (5):**

* **Afraid — Den Down [GM: Capture/Separate].** It vanishes into a maze of tunnels. **Split the party**: a hero must **follow into darkness and mark Afraid**, or **lose track** of it as it pursues a softer target off‑panel. 
* **Angry — Frenzy Furrow [GM: Collateral].** Ripsnarl chews trenches through gas lines and pillars. **Shatter the environment** and **force a choice**: keep pressing and **mark Guilty**, or burn **1 Team** to shore up supports.  
* **Guilty — Protective Instinct [GM: Take/Offer Influence].** It drags a pinned civilian free and **hesitates**. If a hero accepts the moment and shows kindness, **clear 1 of the badger’s conditions** and that hero can **exercise Influence** over it; if refused, **inflict Guilty** on an onlooker who hates seeing mercy spurned. 
* **Hopeless — Cave‑In Gambit [GM: Reveal Future/Exit].** It hammers load‑bearing earth. **Next panel, collapse** unless someone diverts attention to props or counter‑tunneling. If unopposed, it **escapes the scene** under the rubble; if stopped, it stays but **marks a condition**. 
* **Insecure — Dig Up the Past [GM: Reintroduce Hazard].** Overcompensating, it **reopens** a hazard the team solved (a ruptured main, a fallen transformer, a blocked subway). If that hazard was a minion, they return with **3 conditions already marked**. 

**Villain moves (3–5):**

* **Burrow Ambush [GM: Capture/Separate].** It erupts beneath a target, **yanking them underground** or flinging them across zones. The target **marks a condition** to break free immediately or is **isolated** until the team responds.
* **Claw Hook [GM: Inflict a Condition].** A hooking swipe tears through cover; on a hit, **mark Angry or Afraid** (your choice) unless you concede position or **Take a Powerful Blow**. 
* **Quarry Rattle [GM: Put Innocents in Danger].** Subsonic rumbles **stampede bystanders** toward sinkholes—rescue now or live with the fallout. 
* **Dust‑Out [GM: Take Influence].** Choking dust **scrambles comms**; if you follow the wrong echo, **Ripsnarl takes Influence** over you; defy it and **mark Insecure**.
* **Shatter Brace [GM: Price for Victory].** You can pin it **if** you accept a **costly collapse** nearby—choose lost asset, split team, or **mark Guilty** for causing the cave‑in.
