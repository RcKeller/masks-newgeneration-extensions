BACKGROUND
Mat Fiero and Ian Thorpe met when the two aerialist dancers joined the “Carnevale” troupe of performers in Las Vegas as part of their ongoing and successful stage show. The spark between them was there from the beginning, and they began dating not long after they met, eventually settling into a steady relationship. They planned to get married eventually, but both wanted to focus on their performing careers.
That was all before a theft of certain rare radioactive isotopes from an isolated government research facility in Nevada. The local mob made arrangements for a meeting at the hotel to make the exchange of the goods for the promised cash, but law enforcement and a few heroes caught wind of it, too, and crashed the meeting, forcing the criminals to flee with the goods. Someone started shooting in the midst of all it, and the case carrying the isotopes got hit at least once.
So when the mobster carrying the damaged case of isotopes ducked backstage, he ran right into Mat and Ian getting ready to go on for their part of the performance. The thermogenic isotopes leaking from the case had a profound and immediate reaction on the two of them: Mat exploded into flames, which caused him no harm, but set off the fire alarms and panic in the theater, while Ian was temporarily encased in ice, the temperature around him plummeting to subzero.
The authorities took the criminals into custody and secured the dangerous materials, and managed to bring the two afflicted aerialists in for examination to discovered what happened to them and what could be done. The isotopes triggered some type of mutation. Unfortunately, there was no indication of how to reverse the process. Frustrated, trapped, and angry, the couple broke out of the temporary containment facility look for answers on their own.
Ever since, the “Thermo-Couple” has been on the run from the authorities, relying on the criminal underworld to get by. They’re not bad guys, but circumstances are such that neither of them can even touch each other for very long, nor anyone else, without fear of burning of freezing them, and they feel betrayed by fate and the legal authorities who can do nothing for them. They steal to survive and to get enough money to research or find a cure for their condition and, the longer they do, the deeper in trouble they become with the law. Still, they have each other, and hold on to that in order to make it through, no matter what.
PUTTING ON A SHOW
Fire & Ice and some of the other villains in this book share circus, carnival, rodeo, or theatrical themes, making them potential members of a team of some sort, should they choose to band together for mutual assistance. Some possibilities include:
THE CARNIVAL OF CRIME
The Thermo-Couple could work with carnival or rodeo themed villains, including Enemy Mime, Lasso and Buck Bronco, and possibly Harlequin and Columbina. The girls are likely to get along great with Fire and Ice while the guys...well, Buck doesn’t much care for the couple, Harlequin is jealous of anyone taking away Columbina’s attention, and nobody can tell what the Mime thinks most of the time anyway. For added complications, Monkey Business could also work with the theme. Chances are the alliance is strictly temporary, but could still last long enough to pull off some daring heists before it all comes apart.
THE THEATER OF THE STRANGE
Rather than the circus or carnival theme, Fire and Ice could follow their theatrical background and their penchant for drama and putting on a show to work with villains who share a love of the stage and the dramatic. This might include Harlequin and Columbina, Fortissimo, King Ghost, and Madame Muse, who could be an instigator using her powers to influence the other members of the team into “performing” as she directs. If so, then the other members are not going to be happy when and if her influence wears off or is discovered. If Fortissimo is involved, he’s sure to “steal scenes,” which doesn’t sit well with King Ghost or the Thermo-Couple for very long.
FIERCE!
If they ever met, Fire and Ice would immediately take to Size Queen— her fabulous sense of style, attitude, and sheer power—and the feeling would be mutual. The three of them would make a terrible trio (which Size Queen would dub Fierce!) with her size and strength complementing the Thermo-Couple’s ranged capabilities and power to create obstacles, which Size Queen can easily step right over. They could pull off some spectacular heists and might choose to take on some of the injustices of the world towards them along the way.
