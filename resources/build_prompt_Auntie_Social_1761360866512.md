Biography: Ms. Socha Prath's Overton Academy is a prestigious preparatory school, but it's a front. As "Auntie Social," she runs the "Overturn Academy," brainwashing students in a secret sub-basement to serve her criminal schemes.

She plays the kindly matron role perfectly, but is a spry and devious mastermind who uses her students to steal valuables, sow discord, and even influence heroes through psychic attacks.
