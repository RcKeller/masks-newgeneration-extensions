I got my first contract a month later and went on tour headlining for the Byrds. I moved on to music festivals soon after.\nWhat do you tell people about how you got your powers?\nWhen I was 14, the devil challenged me to a fiddle contest. When I beat him, he gave me a golden fiddle. Nobody can beat me.\nWho, outside of the team, supports your burgeoning star in every way possible?\nI have a team of groupies that follow me everywhere I go. I don't know their names, and I think every now and then we lose some or gain some for various reasons. They're good for security and catching good photo ops. They'd probably lay in a puddle and let me walk on them if I asked them to, so I don't have to get my shoes wet.\nWho, outside of the team, loathes what you represent?\nReligious organizations. I keep telling them, I beat the Devil, which means I'm not him. But they swear my fiddle gives me \"demonic powers\" and that makes me some sort of Anti-Christ.\nWhy do you care about the team?\nSometimes being the best gets boring. …",

The planet is tidally locked (one side always facing towards the sun) causing most civilization to be on the rim between light and dark.\nWhy did you come to Earth?\nDue to terrible solar storms, many of his people fled to other planets and systems. Helio was part of a colony ship which encountered issues traversing the gap between galaxies. His escape pod somehow made it to earth. Helio’s first memories after his pod landed on earth were of pain as he adjusted to Earth’s atmosphere; a cold place for his kind. AEGIS quickly descended upon him, seeing his arrival as a potential Earthly threat.\nWhy do you want to stay here (for now at least)?\nHelio has enjoyed the diversity of Earth and grown curious about its many species and environments. Helio’s true name, Valaista Heikko, means “Dim Light” in his language due to having less control over light than his peers. Yet here on Earth, this is seen as a mighty power.

I close my eyes, my body extends roots into the ground, my skin grows ivy and bark, and I commune with the planet. Nature itself is my caretaker.\nWhat about humanity fascinates you the most?\nLike all other life on this planet, humans are intimately connected to the natural world, but the vast majority of them don't know it, don't feel it and can't understand it.
