## SESSION 1

The team is brought to a studio for interviews, as each of the characters have shown sufficient ability to be considered for a team. During the interview process the Vermissian Knight, a (rival? Creation?) of Casshan appeared and attempted to disrupt the event! While trying to use their powers to hold the Vermissian Knight, Nullpoint’s power attracted another version of the Vermissian Knight from an alternate reality, Vermissian Light, looking a bit like a Temu knockoff. After some provocation from Enthalpy and Lady Whiteswallow, Arpeggio was able to convince Vermissian that this could all “disappear” if they stopped what they were doing. While repeating “disappear” over and over, the Vermissian Knight disappeared from the scene.

While assessing the situation, The Green Man noticed a horde of people trying to enter the room! Casshan went to engage the horde and was trampled by them as they broke the glass to enter the studio. This horde is the Fiddle Fiends; a group of rabid fans of Arpeggio! Arpeggio’s handler, “Nerd”, gave them coupons to Arpeggio’s Cameo which began to placate them. In the mean time, Temo bot’s arm fell off and exploded, causing harm to one of the Fiddle Fiends which angered Arpeggio. Lady Whiteswallow and the Green Man unleash some water on the Temu bot, shorting some of it’s circuits. Arpeggio provokes their fan base to go after the robot. Helio sets up some fantastic lighting for Arpeggio to help them out and also take focus off the rest of the team.

Off in another part of the building, Kris is being interviewed by Sharron, the HR rep. They manage to fight off her influence and are brought to the press briefing. Casshan sends their robot dog on Vermissian Light, turning them to a pile of scrap. With the fans placated, we are rushed off to the cafeteria by Sharron where we debrief.

_Welcome to MASKS: Volume 2!_


Cold Open: The Armory (3–5 pages)
---------------------------------

**What we see:** metal lockers, gear racks, red emergency strobes; a chalkboard with a “dead pool” scrawl. Switchgear wipes it away: “Couldn’t find 12 of them, Sharon?”  
**NPCs:**

*   **Switchgear** (handler): calm, blank read; plays things down, then vanishes mid-scene.
    
*   **Sharon** (AEGIS HR): already arguing with **Wendy** (eager young hero). Sharon’s corporate power-moves can _redefine stakes_ mid-scene—use **Per My Last Email…**, **Mandatory 1:1**, or **PIP** to split the party, impose scrutiny, or shift a roll down after the fact.
    

**Soft prompts**

*   “What did you level into?” (spotlight each choice for a beat; seed how it might complicate today).
    
*   “What do you grab from the armory and why?” (foreshadow a cost or entanglement).
    
*   “Alarms blare from downtown.” Wendy wants to bolt; Sharon forbids it.
    

**Fork the story**

*   If the team defies Sharon → **Scenario A: Chinatown**.
    
*   If they play along / are redirected / want glamor or info-gathering → **Scenario B: Halcyon City Gala**.
    
*   If someone gets hurt or wants safety → **Scenario C: Clinic (Injury)**.
    

* * *

Scenario A: Chinatown—Crowds, Cooks, & Chaos
--------------------------------------------

**Set-up beats**

1.  Arrive to a dense, phone-wielding crowd; news-choppers; neon signs and steam vents.
    
2.  **Switchgear wanders off** (seed suspicion). Encourage the team to _split_: fans, alleys, rooftops, kitchen backdoor. (Ask “who’s taking point on civilians?” → trigger _Assess/Defend_ as needed.)
    
3.  **The Culinary Crew** (funny, low-threat villains): ladles-as-axes, noodle nets, grease traps, improvised wok-shields. Keep it light, fast, collateral-prone.
    

**Make it Masks**

*   When fists fly, **Enter Battle as a Team** (build/trim Team, align purpose, call out mistrust).
    
*   Use **crowd-as-threat**: deploy **Fiddle Fiends** (Arpeggio’s groupies) as a roaming hazard that knocks heroes prone, overshadows non-Arpeggio heroes, and weaponizes selfies to inflict **Insecure** or create Janus/secret-ID complications. Moves: **Mosh Pit**, **Riding His Coat Tails**, **But First…Let Me Take a Selfie**.
    
*   If anyone’s drowning in attention, let Arpeggio pop **Time for the Show** (onlookers watching), or lean the **Audience** demands hard—clear a condition by accepting their label, or mark potential on a hit rejecting it (and expect blowback).
    

**Spice the fight**

*   Light villains trade blows; the **mob** creates opportunities and collateral (slip hazards, scalding broth). _Directly Engage_ triggers; if you want harm to sting, call **Take a Powerful Blow**.
    
*   **Wendy** is a magnet for danger. On a 6-, injure her (non-lethal), forcing choices: protect vs pursue.
    

**Escalation paths**

*   If they **win cleanly**: the Culinary Crew flees through a clinic transport tunnel → **Scenario C**.
    
*   If they **reposition/retreat** with civilians: AEGIS **Clinic** triage → **Scenario C**.
    
*   If stakes feel **heavy** or mood is dragging: smash-cut to **Scenario B (Gala)** as a “public commendation invite” or “damage-control PR”—Sharon re-frames the day and ushers them to the gala.
    

* * *

Scenario B: The Halcyon City Gala—Masks Off?
--------------------------------------------

**Questions to ask out loud**

*   “Are you in costume or in civvies?” (labels & secrecy matter; prep _Mild-Mannered/Pierce/Provoke/Comfort_ moments).
    
*   “Who here do you want to impress?” (Queue Star/Legacy-ish energy even if you don’t have one.)
    

**Spotlights**

*   **Arpeggio**: Guests recognize him; **asked to perform**. If he performs: _Time for the Show_; name 2 NPCs who now owe him or complicate him. If he refuses: Audience **demands** escalate (clear/mark per Star move results).
    
*   **Jack** (potential LI): neurodivergent, sincerely curious; clicks with **Outsider or Newborn** (if present)—“Maybe we can be different, together.” Offer a quiet balcony scene (great for _Comfort or Support_ / _Team Moves_).
    
*   **Enthalpy** wine-spill prompt (if that PC exists): choice to use powers publicly → out them (rolls cascade: _Unleash_ risk, then social fallout via Influence/labels).
    

**Villainy at black-tie**

*   Small, stylish fracas: **The Director**, **Scrumlord**, **Disco Bandit**, **Accordion Thief**.
    
    *   Use **The Director** to _meta-cut_ scenes: **Cut!** (re-take a move at -2 or keep and mark 2 conditions), **Inspired by Tarantino** (everyone marks a condition; style your move for a bonus), **Director’s Cut** (bring back a “solved” hazard). He’s perfect to punish splits, or goose pacing.
        
*   **Switchgear** whispers: “Chinatown is flaring up again.” If energy dips or party gets messy → **Trigger A** pivot.
    

* * *

Scenario C: The Clinic—White Coats, Red Flags
---------------------------------------------

**Tone:** fluorescent kindness with militarized logistics. Doctors are competent and warm; security is cold.

**Beats**

1.  **Talk up the surgical staff.** Offer **Casshan** a hard temptation: “With your mind, you could rebuild what was damaged.” (_Always Prepared_ gadgets; _Scientific Insight_\-style logic if you want to frame it; swing hard into ethics and consequence).
    
2.  **Attack on the clinic.** Infiltrators followed them (or were already inside). Lights cut, auto-doors lock, someone’s in the OR. _Defend_, _Unleash_, _Assess_, then **Enter Battle as a Team** as alarms cascade.
    
3.  **If The Doomed is on the team**, drop a **Doomsign**: visions of a sealed surgical wing, or a name (“Vermissian”). If not, echo it through **Casshan’s Shame**: a file, a silhouette, or an inhuman gait on the cameras—**The Vermissian Knight** exists…in some form. Pushing Casshan’s shame: mark a condition or shift Superior↓ / Danger↑ if confronted.
    

**Outcomes**

*   **AEGIS asset or AEGIS trap?** If they save the day but make a mess, Sharon arrives with a PIP-style review. If they cooperate, gain an asset; if they resist, escalate adult attention later.
    

* * *

GM move kit (drop-in)
---------------------

*   **Soft**: announce future badness (siren routes; camera flashes), put someone in a spot (Wendy under a scaffolding), show costs of collateral (grease fire spreads), offer an opportunity with a cost (backstage access if Arpeggio “performs” a statement).
    
*   **Hard**: separate them, take away their stuff (signal jammers), inflict a condition (Insecure via headlines; Angry via heckling), or **turn their move back on them** (The Director’s “Cut!” or Sharon’s paperwork).
    

* * *

Character-specific hooks
------------------------

### Arpeggio — **The Star** (sonic control; audience machine)

*   **Scene candy**
    
    *   **Chinatown:** the **Fiddle Fiends** worship you but endanger others—choose: bask (buff yourself, overshadow the team) or redirect them (Comfort the crowd to clear their “Insecure” cascade).
        
    *   **Gala performance:** use **Time for the Show**; NPCs must admire/help/ask something big. If you reject your audience’s label, mark potential on a hit and invite retribution (paparazzi calls; “Were you lip-syncing?”).
        
*   **Pressure levers**: audience **demands perfection and major heroics**; a stumble fuels _Insecure/Guilty_ and PR strings attached to any help. (That’s your Audience extra.)
    
*   **If you share triumph**: is it part of the show or not? Shift Labels / clear a condition accordingly. Great after a rooftop duet or mid-fight riff.
    

### Casshan — **The Brain** (genius; robotic sidekick; Shame = Vermissian Knight)

*   **Scene candy**
    
    *   **Clinic temptation:** surgeons ask for a miracle prosthesis in minutes; spend **gadget hold** to pull a device, but mark a condition at 0 gadgets.
        
    *   **Shame Foreshadow:** security footage shows a **flesh-steel silhouette** stepping between frames. Confrontation = either mark a condition or shift Superior↓ Danger↑.
        
*   **Team economy**: **Above the Fray** adds Team when you advise the leader; you can _contradict_ later to add more (and stir drama). Perfect when Sharon “audits” a teammate and you step in—or cut their mic.
    
*   **Debrief**: later, **downplay** your help (mark potential) or **exaggerate** (clear a condition) and adjust Influence. Slot this after the gala photo op.
    

### Plug-and-play hooks if you have them

*   **The Doomed**: a **Doomsign** vision at the clinic: a _countdown_ overlay on the operating theater door; mark doom to ask “What happens if I open it?”
    
*   **The Janus**: selfie swarm (Fiddle Fiends) threatens secret identity; _Mild-Mannered_ can thread the needle or blow up in your face.
    
*   **The Outsider/Newborn**: **Jack** asks achingly literal questions about humanity; _Comfort or Support_ with Freak instead of Mundane (if using Outsider moves), or write a **Newborn lesson** mid-scene.
    

* * *

Foreshadowing & mysteries (plant 2–3)
-------------------------------------

*   **“Couldn’t find 12 of them, Sharon?”**
    
    *   Missing: **twelve prototypes** (limb cassettes Casshan scrapped), or **twelve Culinary Crew line cooks** who never clocked out, or **twelve ‘audience members’** who follow Arpeggio across city grids like a simulation glitch.
        
*   **Why are they hunting the team?**
    
    *   a) **Scrumlord** auctions teen-hero footage; the team is click-bait.
        
    *   b) **The Director** is paid to manufacture a “fall from grace” arc (he can _bring back resolved complications_).
        
    *   c) **AEGIS internal audit** (Sharon) wants leverage to either _own_ the team or shut them down; she frames saves as policy violations.
        
*   **Who gives the orders?**
    
    *   **Accordion Thief** plays courier for a voice called **“The Sommelier”**—pairings of heroes and disasters are _curated_.
        
    *   **Vermissian signal** from the clinic sub-basement pings _across_ time (Casshan’s shame); a director needs a monster in Act 3.
        

* * *

Pacing toggles (use anytime)
----------------------------

*   **Too heavy?** Hard cut to a **gala interview bit** (two questions, one microphone): PCs pick _Provoke_ or _Comfort_ to steer the headline.
    
*   **Too silly?** Power fails at the clinic; heartbeat monitor flatlines in the OR. _Defend_ with consequences.
    
*   **Party split?** Use **The Director** to literally split the comic into panels and make each side pay a cost to re-sync. **“Cut!”** forces retakes/conditions; **“And… action!”** spikes enemy tempo.
    

* * *

Concluding images (choose your tag)
-----------------------------------

*   **Back at the bunker**, Sharon is distraught—shakes clutch of forms: “This isn’t policy. This is…orders.” Who signed them? (Seed next session villain.)
    
*   **Clinic**: an empty gurney, restraints sliced clean; a silhouette on the cam at times that **don’t exist**. (Casshan hook.)
    
*   **Gala**: glitter confetti falls into a police skirmish line; a slow clap from **The Director** as he exits through a service corridor.
    

* * *

End-of-session wrap
-------------------

*   Run the **end-of-session move**: closer to team / into own image / away from team. Resolve Influence shifts & conditions. Queue a debrief montage (great for **Mission Debrief** or **Team Moves**).
    

* * *

### One-card NPC cheatlines

*   **Sharon (AEGIS HR)**: reframes fiction with paperwork; splits parties; “help” with strings; escalates to adult attention. (Use **Per My Last Email**, **Mandatory 1:1**, **PIP**.)
    
*   **Fiddle Fiends (Mob)**: adore Arpeggio; endanger everyone; selfies inflict **Insecure**; stampede threatens civilians.
    
*   **The Director**: meta-villain who edits your comic; forces retakes, amps style, resurrects solved problems. Great when players split or momentum wobbles.
