Background/History: Terrayne is an elemental spirit, one whose existence derives from super- natural templates laid down by powerful wizards during the Atlantean Age. These “spirit matrices” embody pure mystical elements, such as Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, Order, and Chaos, allowing one who’s mastered them to effortlessly summon servants made from those substances.
In 2003 the Demonologist attempted to use
an Atlantean spell he’d recently discovered to summon a new, powerful ally for the Devil’s Advo- cates. But due to his imperfect knowledge of the Atlantean tongue he botched the spell, acciden- tally allowing the Spirit Matrix of Earth to spawn a sentient avatar. The resulting creature, Terrayne, was far too powerful to be controlled; instead,
it defeated the Advocates, imprisoned them in a deep cavern, and then set about taking control of the city of Rochester, New York. After a series of violent confrontations the Sentinels defeated him and dispersed his body by breaking the binding spell.
But a Spirit Matrix cannot be destroyed
as easily as that. Terrayne slowly rebuilt his physical body in a cavern below the Earth. There he encountered a tribe of Mole Men, refugees from Lemurian lands, who worshipped him as
a god. Terrayne formed them into an army and attempted to storm the walls of Arcadia itself. Unfortunately for him he chose a time when the Sentinels were visiting their old friend Archon. The combined power of the Sentinels and Empy- reans was too much for Terrayne, who abandoned his “army” and fled. The creature now dwells far below the Earth’s surface, from where he plots his epic revenge....
Personality/Motivation: Terrayne is a being of magic, so his personality and thought processes aren’t entirely fathomable to human beings. In general he thinks of himself as a god of the earth, and as a being of power so vast no one can truly defeat him for long. He’s a being of emotional extremes who really can’t comprehend any view- point other than his own.
Because he’s particularly vulnerable to Water- based magics and attacks, Terrayne hates and
fears beings with Water powers. If such a being confronts him, he’s likely to lash out with his most powerful attacks in an effort to defeat that being immediately. If that doesn’t work, he’ll flee unless he succeeds with an EGO Roll to stand his ground.
Quote: “I am the living embodiment of the Earth, the undying rock and stone beneath your feet. You are foolish to think you can stop me!”

Powers/Tactics: Terrayne’s powers all relate to earth and stone. Not only can he create earth and stone out of thin air for some of his powers (like Stone Missiles), he can also control, shape, and manipulate existing earth and stone to attack his foes, protect himself, and even travel. On top of all that, since he’s made of stone he’s superhumanly strong and resilient.
Terrayne fights aggressively, as befits a god. He usually picks the biggest, toughest-looking oppo- nent (typically a brick or powered armor wearer) and attacks him all-out. When that foe’s down, he moves on to the next one, and so forth.
Campaign Use: Besides spearheading all sorts
of attacks against humanity, Terrayne gives you access to all sorts of other plots involving Atlan- tean magic. Are other Spirit Matrices lurking out there waiting for someone to find them? (Could Glacier perhaps be one?) Have Atlantean artifacts of great power survived the Cataclysm and the centuries?
To make Terrayne tougher, increase his Phys- ical Damage Reduction to 75% and give him 50% Energy Damage Reduction as well. To weaken him, remove his Damage Reduction and reduce his SPD to 4.


Appearance: Terrayne is an oversized monster who seems to have been carved out of the side of
a basalt mountain. He has rough, almost “unfin- ished” features and craggy protrusions at his joints and extremities. His eyes look like small pools of burning lava in his massive, oversized face, and his mouth takes up far too much of his head.


TERRAYNE FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Terrayne if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Terrayne is a supervillain who’s made of earth and rock and has control over those same substances.
K/R: Terrayne once attacked Arcadia with the help of a small army of renegade Lemurian Mole-Men.
-1: Terrayne can draw upon the very substance of the Earth to grow to enormous size and become even stronger and tougher than normal.
-2: Terrayne isn’t actually a supervillain per se; he’s an Atlantean elemental who was “created” by the Demonologist during a botched summoning. He thinks of himself as a god.
-6: Water-based attacks are particularly effective against Terrayne; he hates and fears superhumans or mages with Water powers.
