Background/History: While undergoing basic training in the United States Army, Jason Redhorse attracted the attention of his superior officers for his combination of discipline, skill, ruthlessness, and intelligence — the perfect attri- butes for a spy. He was soon assigned to work for the Defense Intelligence Agency, and quickly rose through the ranks thanks to his impressive track record at completing missions and gathering intel no one else could.
His accomplishments soon earned him a posting on a prestigious project to gather intel- ligence on, and find ways to combat, superhuman criminals and terrorists. For several years, he studied their personalities, their crimes, and the effects of their activities. Slowly, rage built within him. These... beings (he couldn’t even bring himself to call them men anymore) were like callous gods, flaunting their powers and not caring who got hurt. Some of them actually expressed contempt for human beings, and went out of their way to harm, abuse, and kill them.
Eventually, he couldn’t take it anymore. Just studying them wasn’t enough. Someone had to do something about this problem. The govern- ment seemed content to leave the actual fighting to the superheroes (amateurs who, in Redhorse’s opinion, usually weren’t much better than the criminals they fought). Since no one else was willing to tackle the job, he’d do it.
With the support of his wife Barbara, a Millen- nium City police records officer (and Army veteran herself), Redhorse quit the Army and disappeared. He spent two years training himself and building weapons for his one-man war on supercrime. When he judged himself ready, he donned a distinctive uniform (the better, he thought, to gain a reputation and perhaps fit in with like-minded superheroes) and hit the streets as Thunderbird. And slowly but surely, he began racking up a body count. As of 2010, he’s believed responsible for the murders of nearly 37 super- villains, including Conquistador, the Crimson Cavalier, Earthmover, Nightwhisper, Powerplay, Raptorman, Steel Lightning, Terabyte, Xargak, five VIPER Nest Leaders, and three DEMON Morbanes... and he shows no signs of slowing down.
Personality/Motivation: Thunderbird is a driven, almost obsessed, man. He’s convinced supercrime is an epidemic problem — and that neither the police, the government, nor the world’s superhe- roes are truly prepared, logistically or psychologi- cally, to deal with it properly. He views himself as the one man who knows how things really are and is capable of doing the work that has to be done.

As far as he’s concerned, there’s no supervillain out there who doesn’t deserve a blaster-bolt through the head, and he’s happy to provide. So great is his hatred of superhumans that he finds it difficult to work with superheroes (even the few who share his ideals), and will often ignore a serious crime being committed by normal criminals to pursue a relatively minor supervillain who’s not currently hurting anyone.
Quote: “You’ve got to pay the price for your crimes, Nightwhisper. And I’m here to collect.”
Powers/Tactics: Thunderbird is a highly-trained man in the peak of physical conditioning who equips himself with powerful high-tech weaponry to fight superhuman crime. He carries five blasters — an assault rifle-style weapon, three pistols of various configurations, and a carbine equipped for sniping — in hip and shoulder holsters, his right boot, slung over his back, and so forth. He’s also got a small arsenal of grenades in his belt pouches and a questionite-bladed combat knife. If neces- sary, he can also call on his combat training and fight unarmed as well.
Thunderbird isn’t stupid; he knows how difficult his chosen quarry is to hunt and kill, and he brings every ounce of tactical smarts he has to bear on any combat situation. He prefers to strike from a distance (with his carbine, he can shoot targets over two kilometers away) and/or from ambush, since he lacks the defenses to stand up to most supervillains in a one-on-one battle. If confronted with more than he can handle, he’ll usually drop a smoke grenade and attempt a stra- tegic withdrawal.
Campaign Use: Like Nebula and Captain Chronos, Thunderbird is a hero whom the PCs likely will neither completely understand nor agree with. In fact, some of them may regard him as no better than the criminals he kills, and devote a lot of time to trying to capture him. That’s perfect; he should evoke strong emotions, and raise in the PCs’ minds questions about law, justice, and the acceptable levels of force they apply when fighting crimes themselves.
Because he’s likely to work by himself in most scenarios, you may need to give Thunderbird Bases, Vehicles, or other resources not already listed on his character sheet. He has no objection to applying overwhelming levels of force against his enemies, so bombs, traps, and the like aren’t out of the question — though he’d never know- ingly endanger innocent citizens with such things.
If you want to make Thunderbird tougher,
the first thing he needs is more defense — and perhaps a point of SPD. Then you can think about increasing the DCs of his weapons, or even giving him more weapons. A “utility belt” (a Multipower of small, useful gadgets) wouldn’t be a bad idea, either. If he’s too tough, your best bet is to scale down his weapons to the point where he’s not quite so deadly.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Thunder- bird is a lone wolf — he hunts superhumans, he doesn’t work with them. However, he might make an exception for a superhero who truly shares his vigilante attitude and doesn’t flaunt his super- human abilities too much. He would definitely
get along with Wayland Talos; the underworld gadgeteer could be a good supplier/ally for him. He’d also be a good partner for Nebula, assuming he could bring himself to trust her that she’s sending criminals away and they can never return. Similarly, he and Witchfinder would make a great team for taking out mystic villains. He and Utility could be good partners... except for Utility’s Code Versus Killing.
Appearance: Thunderbird is a 6’2” tall, well- muscled man with dark hair. He wears a black bodysuit with red boots, belt, equipment belt, and bracers/gloves, with a red thunderbird symbol
on his chest. He doesn’t wear a mask, but instead hides his identity behind red one-way combat glasses.
