LASH FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Lash if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Lash is a supervillain armed with a super-tech steel-fiber whip.
K/R: Lash is mostly active in Vibora Bay and the surrounding region, but if someone hires him for a job he’s willing to go just about anywhere.
-2: Lash also carries a few smoke grenades.
-4: Despite the fearsomeness of his weapon, Lash isn’t particularly violent; he prefers to scare opponents away by impressing them with whip tricks,
or attacking them “indirectly” (such as making a shelf fall on a foe and trap him for a few moments so Lash can get away).
-10: His Secret Identity is Mike Braddock.

Background/History: Mike Braddock got his start in the underworld as a teenage shoplifter, and as he grew older graduated into robbery and burglary. He was a pretty good second-story man, but he realized there were limits to how much he could accomplish as an everyday thief. He needed a trademark, a gimmick, something that both made his job easier and let him do it with flair. After watching a liontamer at the circus control big cats with nothing but a whip, Braddock decided that was the perfect weapon for him.
Through his underworld contacts, Braddock got in touch with Brainchild, who manufactured a whip of fine steel mesh for him, plus an armored costume and some smoke grenades. Braddock practiced with his new equipment for weeks until he was a master of the whip. Then he put on his costume and set out to make his mark in the underworld as Lash, the swashbuckling thief.
Personality/Motivation: Lash is pretty typical
as super-thieves go. He loves money, riches, and luxury items, and doesn’t care what he has to do to obtain them. (However, despite the weapon he uses, he’s not a hardened killer, and in fact prefers not to hurt people at all if he can avoid it — he’d rather scare them off with an example of how skilled he is at using his whip and an accompa- nying Presence Attack.) The only thing he likes more than money is women; he has a habit of hitting on any superheroine he fights.
Quote: “Ah, my dear, you fight so well! But why should we fight when there are so many more pleasant ways we might physically engage one another?”
Powers/Tactics: Lash is a clever combatant who prefers to maintain some distance between himself and his opponents so he can use his whip to
best effect — if an enemy closes to within HTH Combat range, he’ll make a Half Move (prefer- ably using Swinging) to re-establish some space between them. He often fights “indirectly” — instead of just striking an opponent with his whip, he might, for example, use a whip-blow to damage one of the legs on a shelf so that the shelf falls on his opponent.
Campaign Use: Lash is lighthearted and non- threatening enough that he might make a good Rival for a PC — perhaps they’re both pursuing the same woman, for instance. To make him more powerful, give him more weapons and gadgets, such as spring-boots, a blaster built into his gloves, or the like. To weaken him, remove his Martial Arts.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Lash has a (totally unrequited) crush on the Black Mask, and often goes out of his way to try to impress and “woo” her.
