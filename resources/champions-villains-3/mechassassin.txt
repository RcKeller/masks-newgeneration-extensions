Background/History: Craig Vandersnoot was a major in the US Army assigned as a liaison to NATO. His good looks, charming demeanor, master’s degree in political science, and take- charge attitude made him popular and respected, and before long he was put in command of a NATO research project to develop a light battle- suit for use by the military and law enforcement.
The project was going well under Vander- snoot’s supervision when his “moonlighting” came to light: he’d been working as a security consultant and troubleshooter for several orga- nized crime groups and terrorist organizations, accepting huge sums of money to keep them safe from the cops. He even helped plan and execute crimes, applying his tactical knowledge to make the “missions” go as smoothly as possible.
Three MPs were sent to arrest Vandersnoot quietly so the press wouldn’t get wind of things. He killed all three of them, snuck back into the research complex, and put on the battlesuit. Then he murdered every scientist and technician associated with the project, stole all the plans and specs, and trashed the lab. When he was done, he escaped from the facility with ease.
Since then, Vandersnoot, operating under the codename Mechassassin, has established an envi- able reputation in the Mercenary World. Known for his skill, power, discipline, and ability to get even the toughest jobs done, he’s made millions as he loots and pillages his way across the globe. He also works as a security chief and military trainer for master villains.
In 2007 the Champions at long last captured Mechassassin, and in light of his skills and the escape risk he posed he was sentenced to serve his twenty-year term in Stronghold. Unfortu- nately for the world, he was only there two years when the 2009 breakout set him free. Now he’s on the outside again and more dangerous than ever.
Personality/Motivation: Mechassassin is cool, collected, efficient, professional, and deadly. His self-confidence borders on arrogance; he knows he’s the best, and that when you put him on a job that job’s as good as done. Proud without being stupid, ruthless without being sadistic, disci- plined without being a machine, he epitomizes the super-mercenary in the modern world.
Like any mercenary worthy of the name, Mechassassin keeps his employers’ identities and related information confidential. He’ll go to prison or take a bullet in the head before he reveals anything he’s supposed to keep secret.
Quote: “When you’re the best, you can get away with murder.”

Powers/Tactics: Mechassassin’s suit of light battlearmor comes equipped with numerous weapons that give him enough of an edge in combat to stand up against superheroes. The main one is an electric rifle with three settings (regular, crispy, and extra crispy); attached to the side of the rifle is a tanglecoil launcher that he can use to trap enemies without hurting them. The rifle assembly fits over his right gauntlet in a way that prevents him from using his right hand for anything else while the gun’s operational, but he can take it off and carry it in a “sheath” on his back if necessary.
Additionally, several of the minor structures on Mechassassin’s armor (such as the ones on the outer edge of his thighs) are actually “grenade packs” he can detach and throw; he carries concussor, tranquilizer gas, and enhanced smoke varieites. Lastly, on his left arm Mechassassin carries a shield with which to deflect enemy attacks.
But Mechassassin’s greatest weapons are
his mind and body. A soldier with years
of experience in just about every sort of
combat imaginable, he has a high degree of tactical awareness. He never fights stupidly, underestimates his opponents (especially superpowered ones), or takes foolish risks.
He usually has at least two backup plans for
every mission, plus one standard and one alternate escape route.
Mechassassin’s choice of weapons and tactics depends on who he’s facing. If he’s confronting a group of foes, or enemies he can’t hit with normal attacks, he’ll use his Tranq Gas Grenades, or “pop smoke” and take advantage of the fact he can
see through the stuff and they (hopefully) can’t. Against bricks and energy projectors, he’ll use his shield for protection and shoot with his Electric Rifle, perhaps making a Multiple Attack with slot 1 or 2 if he has enough cover to compensate for the reduced DCV. Gadgeteers, weaponmasters, and other characters using Accessible Foci get the tanglecoil, followed by tranq gas.
Campaign Use: Like Lazer and the Steel Commando, Mechassassin is a “super-mercenary” (though a somewhat more powerful one), suitable for employment by just about any other villain. He works well with groups, whether as a leader or follower.
If you need to make Mechassassin more powerful, augment his battlearmor. Give it
some more Armor, and maybe some additional features, like a jetpack. You can also give him more weapons, such as shoulder-mounted mini-rocket launchers. If he’s too tough for your heroes, get rid of some of his martial arts, tone his weapons down to 75 or 60 Active Points, and decrease his Charac- teristics a bit (including reducing his SPD to 5).
Mechassassin rarely Hunts heroes (unless someone pays him to), but when he does, he’s a tough and tenacious foe. He approaches his goal — to kill the hero — as if it were a military target. He gathers as much intel as he can, then plans attacks for the maximum chance of scoring a kill with the least amount of risk possible.


Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: As a super-mercenary par excellence, Mechassassin has worked for a lot of villains and organizations over the years, and most would be willing to hire him again if necessary. These include Holo- caust, Joseph Otanga, Merc-Force 1, VIPER, and ARGENT. He’s also occasionally partnered with villains such as Blackguard, Cateran, Ricochet, and Tachyon.
But of course being a super-mercenary means he competes with business for others of his ilk, such as Double Dealer, Hazard, Lazer, and Steel Commando. He has a particularly strong rivalry with the latter two and would happily eliminate them if he had the chance. Eurostar also hates him and wants him dead for beating them to a robbery target a few years ago.

Appearance: Mechassassin wears a suit of light battlearmor colored nonreflective grey, with some dull blue and light purple highlights; he sometimes changes the suit’s colors, if appropriate for a given mission.
