DOCTOR TENEBER
Background/History: A car crash killed Dr. Charles Tenover’s wife and children. The drunken teenager who crashed into them lived. Tenover had to watch his family die; his vaunted medical skills were in vain.
The counselors babbled about the grieving process; the priests said God’s will worked in mysterious ways. They had no real answer to the riddle of why people died before their time and what lay beyond the grave. They could only tell him to accept his helplessness. Hah! He was a surgeon, and a good one. His training — his whole life — was built around intervention, using his knowledge and skills to save lives. He turned his search to the occultists and magicians who prom- ised miracles.
Just when despair threatened to overwhelm him, Tenover found a mayombero, a practitioner of palo mayombe — a dark and morbid “Voodoo” cult that exploited the spirits of the dead — and the necromancer’s powers were frighteningly real. Tenover, however, was beyond fear. Tenover begged to learn the secrets of palo mayombe. The mayombero’s patron spirits approved, and so the surgeon became a sorcerer’s apprentice.
Tenover learned quickly. Magic didn’t seem that hard compared to his internship. After a few years, though, Tenover realized palo mayombe alone would not restore his family to life.
He needed to learn more. He abandoned his master to spend several more years scouring
the world for necromantic secrets: the zombies of Haiti; Tibetan lore of reincarnation; the grim witchcraft of Thessaly; the mortuary magic of ancient Egypt. A Haitian bokor mispronounced Tenover’s name and gave him his magical pseud- onym: Doctor Teneber.
The onetime surgeon is now one of the
world’s more powerful necromancers. He partly succeeded in his quest: Doctor Teneber really
can raise the dead, under certain circumstances... which, unfortunately, his long-dead wife and chil- dren do not fulfill, because he cannot find their ghosts.
Dr. Teneber finds other consolations. He now runs a botanica — a voodoo/santería supply shop — in what could politely be called a “colorful ethnic neighborhood.” It’s a living. Despite
losing his doctor’s license, Tenover also provides mundane health care to his neighborhood. Most importantly, Dr. Teneber secretly uses his powers to bring some order to the vagaries of life and death. If God does not decree that good people
live and bad people die, then Dr. Teneber will. He seeks the unquiet spirits of those who died before their time, and living people who seem entirely destructive to those around them. He destroys the living person’s soul and binds the ghost into the victim’s body, for a sort of reincarnation.
Doctor Teneber also intervenes when super- natural forces endanger the innocent. He has helped several mystic heroes — but not a one of them considers him a fellow hero. Apart from
his unnerving necromantic magic, the doctor’s arrogant, vigilante-esque decisions of life, death, and resurrection appall most mystics. So far, Dr. Teneber’s help against undeniable evils outweighs the revulsion and mistrust felt by other heroes. So far.
Personality/Motivation: As a transplant surgeon, Charles Tenover routinely chose who lived and who died. He doesn’t consider it playing God to kill one soul to resurrect another — it’s more a sort of preëmptive triage, to preserve the greatest number and quality of lives. Other mystics, he believes, are not tough-minded enough to cope with the evils that threaten the world; and so he must make the hard choices for them.
Quote: “Mr. Johnson? I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is you’re dead. The good news is your condition is reversible....”
Powers/Tactics: Doctor Teneber knows a wide range of necromantic spells, both for combat and for investigation. Not only can he cast bolts of deathly energy, trap enemies in bone cages, or bind souls to obedience, he can take on ghostly properties such as invisibility, moving through solid objects, or the terror that comes from meeting the dead. He can also contact the souls
of the dead to question them, if he has part of
the body or something else close to the deceased. His strangest attack forces a ghost (or other astral spirit) to materialize, so it can be fought more easily.
The Doctor of the Dead can create various low- powered undead creatures (see The HERO System Bestiary for character sheets for common types
of undead beings). He has no particular desire to raise ghouls or zombies, but if he needs a diver- sion and didn’t like the dead person anyway, he might do it.
Most importantly, Teneber can place the spirit of a dead person in someone else’s body. Since living but soulless bodies are hard to come by, Teneber usually captures a person he believes will never cause anything but evil, kills him to drive the soul from the body, then uses his medical skills to revive the body for its new owner. The murder incidentally counts as a sacrifice to Tene- ber’s various patron death-gods, who consume the victim’s soul.
Since Dr. Teneber knows he’s weak in toe-to- toe combat compared to most heroes and villains, he prefers to strike from ambush. He may watch a target for days or weeks before making his move. Sometimes he lures enemies into traps. His forensic skills ensure that victims disappear without a trace.
Campaign Use: Doctor Teneber occupies a disturbing middle ground between heroism and villainy. While his goals are often laudable, his methods are not. Does the end justify the means? Teneber thinks so... your PCs may disagree.
To make Dr. Teneber more powerful, increase his DEX and SPD, and reduce Limitations on his Necromancy Multipower. You could also raise his defenses. To make him less powerful, reduce the number and power of his spells.
Doctor Teneber could Hunt a hero if he believed the hero was actually a villain, or if the hero Hunted him first. If anyone tries to end Teneber’s life-swapping ways, he certainly fights back with all his ruthless cunning. Teneber could also Hunt a hero who got on the wrong side of one of the necromancer’s divine patrons, expecially Baron Samedi.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Doctor Teneber doesn’t consider himself a “superhuman” and generally holds himself aloof from most doings in both the Superhuman and Mystic Worlds. He’s had several run-ins with the Sylvestri Clan (see CV2) and would happily remove any
of them from this mortal coil and then use their bodies for something better. He’s stopped several of the Circle of the Scarlet Moon’s minor plots, earning him the enmity of some members of that organization. If he becomes too much of a thorn in the Circle’s side it may come after him in force, starting a “war” that could easily put innocents in danger.
The Trismegistus Council keeps an eye on Dr. Teneber when it can. It doesn’t always approve
of his actions or methods, but he does fight evil mystics, and the Council needs all the help it can get, so it generally leaves him alone on the theory that it has bigger fish to fry right now.
Appearance: Charles Tenover has an unremark- able appearance: average height, slender build, short, black hair streaked with grey, and a mixed- race complexion that could pass as light-skinned black or swarthy white. As Dr. Teneber, he wears a black suit with plenty of pockets for medical equipment; a black, sleeved cloak with a high collar fastened by a brooch of silver and human bone; and broad-brimmed, high-crowned hat that leaves his face in perpetual shadow. He carries a bone cane tipped with a silver ball, with streamers of black rags tied just below the ball. Pale, firefly light swirls around the head of the cane when Teneber casts major spells.
