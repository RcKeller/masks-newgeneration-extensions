Background/History: He arose in the minds of
the earliest men, birthed by the fears and doubts which all too often afflicted them. Thereafter, nothing could destroy him; even after cataclysms of the world, he remains still, feeding off the terrors in the minds of men. He was here when the British Isles first thrust their putrid green heads above the waves, lurking in the forests and moun- tains and hills and meadows. He has seen the Romans, Arthur, Normans, Shakespeare, Crom- well, Pitt, Victoria, Churchill, and many others come to life, live, and die, existing always within the shadow of his glorious fear. And even today, when the heroes are of a different sort, with gaudy costumes and foolish names, he remains strong and undefeatable — for wherever there exists a mind susceptible to fear, he can live on....
Personality/Motivation: Samhain is an ancient spirit of evil and fear. He exists only to inspire and “sculpt” fear in human beings and animals, and he feeds on that fear. While content to thrive on the fears of small, individual minds, he prefers the greater taste and nourishment of fear on a wide scale — such as he helped to foster during the Battle of Britain in World War II.
Quote: “You cannot withstand my touch. Your courage is but a wilting flower compared to my power!”
Powers/Tactics: Samhain’s powers mostly involve the evocation and shaping of fear. He can simply create raw fear within a victim’s heart (Mind Control), or show a victim his greatest specific fears (Mental Illusions). With the latter power, he often tries to achieve a +20 affect so he can cause STUN and BODY damage (he scares the victim so badly, a heart attack ensues). Just being near him makes people more susceptible to Presence Attacks based on fear.
At the GM’s option, Samhain can make a Fear Powers roll to use his Evoke Fear ability in a more tailored fashion — to place so specific a fear in
a victim’s mind that he acts in the way Samhain desires. Typically Samhain would use this power to make people commit random murders, engage in terrorist acts, and do other things that increase the “ambient fear level” within society.
Samhain prefers to operate in secret as much as possible. He lurks in the shadows on the edges of society, using his Stealth and Desolidification to remain unseen. Only when he has the chance to induce fear in a large number of people is he likely to reveal himself openly.
Campaign Use: Although not a “master villain,” Samhain should have sufficient power to oppose an entire group of PCs. His appearance in the campaign should signal a major threat that the PCs have to do their utmost to defeat. If Samhain isn’t sufficiently powerful for this, increase his abilities as appropriate, or add new ones; if he’s too strong for your PCs to have any hope of defeating, reduce his power until he’s just an extremely tough (but not impossible) challenge.
Defeating Samhain should pose great difficul- ties for the heroes. The best method is to trap him an area where there exist no creatures he can affect with his fear-inspiring powers. Confronted with such bravery, he will shrivel and diminish, eventu- ally winking out of existence... or so the heroes should believe. In time Samhain will return in full strength, for who can truly abolish terror?
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Samhain views all humans and their ilk as its victims, play- things, and source of food, not allies to team up with. However, he seems strangely willing to obey Cairngorm’s instructions and has joined forces with him on several occasions.
As a fear-spirit Samhain may be related to
or connected with the Reaper somehow. If so, Samhain may be a “higher order” of such beings, since he creates fear in general whereas the Reaper uses and inspires a specific fear (of death).
Appearance: Samhain resembles a muscular man with a deer’s head and antlers, but the antlers are black and the deer fur (and his body in general) are speckled with ever-bleeding wounds and suppurating sores. He wears no clothes, but a mass of fur/hair covers his waist. He has claws on his hands. His feet are human feet, not deer’s hooves

SAMHAIN FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Samhain if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Samhain is a strange and deadly being who seems to be “native” to the British Isles. Resem- bling a man with a deer’s antlered head, he creates fear and terror wherever he goes.
K/R: It seems that Samhain “feeds” on the fear he evokes in humans.
-2: Samhain has worked with Cairngorm on several occasions and seems to obey his orders; otherwise he never “teams up” with other villains.
-6: Exposure to holy places or objects causes Samhain pain.
