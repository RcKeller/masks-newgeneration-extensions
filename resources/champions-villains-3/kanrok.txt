Background/History: Bored, bored, bored! Kanrok of Malva was utterly bored, and the truth was he’d been that way so long he could barely remember any other emotion. The endless round of parties, concerts, plays, gambling, spectator events, and other distractions that compose Malvan society hadn’t really interested him for decades. Only watching the matches in the gladiatorial arena even began to truly spark his interest.
He’d considered using Malvan super-science to transform himself into a gladiator, but somehow that seemed too... crude, too simplistic. Then one day, at an after-the-fights party, he chanced to hear two people talking. One of them was one of the bounty hunters who kept he Phazor supplied with animals and even people for the gladiato- rial matches. Now that sounded exciting — all the thrill of the chase and the battle, without the annoyance of being on display for the crowd.
A few days of thinking about it was all
Kanrok needed. When he’d made up his mind, he submitted himself to Malva’s machines and few remaining scientists for alteration. He needed
to be as powerful as the prey he would chase, or even moreso, if he were to succeed. He emerged from the laboratories far more than an ordinary Malvan. Now he was Kanrok, Kanrok the Acquisi- tioner, and no one would ever escape him.
Personality/Motivation: Kanrok is a hunter through and through. He lives for the pursuit, the battle, the capture, and finally the adulation of the Phazor and his sycophants. If a particular task isn’t challenging enough for him, he’ll find
a way to make it more to his liking (for example, he might decide to capture someone using only a particular type of attack, or with one arm literally tied behind his back). If he were to find the PCs particularly intriguing opponents, he might even let them go after he captures them, provided they agree to let him try to capture them again.
Quote: “No one escapes Kanrok the Acquisitioner for long.”
Powers/Tactics: Malvan technology has enhanced Kanrok both physically and mentally, giving him the power to project beams of energy (though not ones as powerful as those of his fellow Malvan Firewing), to use mental powers, to lift up to 100 metric tons, and to resist injury. However, due
to flaws in the process that created him (or more accurately, flaws in the way his personal biochem- istry interacted with that process), Kanrok is more strongly affected by weakening attacks (i.e., Drains, in game terms) than other people are.
Kanrok hunts his quarry with intelligence and tenacity. He starts by researching the target so he can learn as much as possible about attacks he might face, abilities the target can use to escape him, and so on. Then he sets out to track his target down. Once he catches up to the target,

he prefers to subdue his quarry with a good, rousing battle; he only uses his Entangle once it’s clear he’s beaten his foe or the foe is unworthy of further combat. In situations where he only wants to capture one person out of a group, he tries to set up a distraction to occupy the others while he focuses on the one he wants.
Campaign Use: Kanrok is meant to be powerful enough to take on most superteams singlehan- dledly. If he’s not, improve him so he is or give him “minions” (either Malvan robots, or supervillains he’s hired for the job) to help him.
To make Kanrok tougher, just equip him with whatever Malvan devices he needs — Malvan technology is so advanced it makes even super- science from Earth seem primitive. He could, for example, easily have his Energy Net Projector Gloves altered so that they can affect Desolidifed targets. To weaken him, get rid of one of his Multi- powers so that he’s either a physical or a mental threat, but not both.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Kanrok looks on just about every superhuman, particularly the powerful ones, as a potential quarry and fodder for the arena, so he doesn’t make friends with them. At the top of his list of targets is Firewing, for returning him to the Malvan arena would bring Kanrok not only great acclaim, but rewards from the Phazor sufficient to buy a dozen planets.
Appearance: Kanrok is a male from the planet Malva, and as such has golden-bronze skin, large eyes, feathery eyebrows, and reddish shoulder- length hair. When pursuing superpowered quarry he wears black boots, pants, gloves, and a sort of vest-like shirt. He doesn’t carry any gadgets or weapons that are visible to the naked eye
