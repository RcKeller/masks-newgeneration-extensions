Background/History: William Huang was once a poor but diligent physics student at Millen- nium City University who was conducting some advanced experiments with electromagnetism. Unfortunately, in his zeal to earn good grades and thus acquire a prestigious job, he ignored his professors’ safety warnings and kept working during a thunderstorm.
The next thing William remembered was waking up on the other side of the lab, his body one big ache. The window was shattered, rain
was blowing inside, and his equipment was in smoldering ruins. Trying to save his notes, but too weak to stand up yet, he gestured feebly at the lab table — only to have a metal test tube stand fly off the table and right into his grasp.
He tried it again, this time snagging a couple
of tools hanging on the wall nearby. The notes were soon forgotten as he tested the extent of his control over magnetism. Before long, he could not only attract or repel ferrous objects, but emit blasts of magnetic force, protect himself with a magnetic shield, and even fly!
And that was the end of William Huang’s academic career. Who needed knowledge to get rich, when one had superpowers? After creating a simple costume and christening himself “Lode- stone,” William embarked on a robbery spree that only ended when Sapphire and Nighthawk helped PRIMUS capture him. A minor slip in PRIMUS’s security routine let him escape. Ever since then he’s back on the street and ready for more action... and money!
Personality/Motivation: Lodestone’s goal as a supervillain is simple: get rich. He grew up poor, and he doesn’t intend to ever be poor again. He mostly commits robberies, though he’ll gladly sign up to work for another supervillain if the pay is good, he’s treated well, and he doesn’t have to do anything distasteful like kill or maim other people. He hasn’t done a good job of saving his money so far — he mostly throws it away on gambling, pres- ents for his wife (who thinks he’s gotten a good job at a research lab), and needless luxuries — but he’s enjoying himself immensely, so he doesn’t care what happens, as long as he can stay out of prison.
Quote: “Kind of hard to shoot me with a bent gun barrel, isn’t it?”
Powers/Tactics: Lodestone’s powers derive from his ability to control magnetism. Many of them only work on ferrous objects — for example, he can only Deflect ferrous attacks (which would
not include many bullets), and his Dispel (repre- senting his ability to shred or otherwise disrupt a metallic object) only affects powers involving iron, steel, and the like (such as many super-technology gadgets). Other powers, such as his Magnetic Blasts, suffer from no such restriction

Even after years in the villain business, Lode- stone hasn’t learned much in the way of super- combat tactics. He tends to pick one foe he knows he can affect and stick to attacking that person until he defeats him or is defeated.
Campaign Use: Lodestone is a mercenary super- villain with just enough conscience to make him interesting. He’s not callous and cruel, like so many supervillains; he doesn’t like to hurt people at all. He just wants as much money as he can possibly get his hands on. But if push comes to shove, he’ll hurt someone rather than let himself get captured. If the GM is looking to expand the ranks of GRAB, Lodestone would make an excel- lent candidate. He fits their modus operandi and attitude perfectly.
Lodestone should fit into most Standard Superheroic Champions campaigns pretty well. Increasing his power usually means increasing the value of his Multipower reserves and slots, and sometimes boosting his DEX, CON, and/or SPD. To weaken him, reduce the Active Points in his powers.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Lodestone usually works by himself (he gets to keep all the loot that way!), but sometimes teams up with other villains or hires himself out. For example,
he joined Holocaust’s temporary “team” in 2006, and has worked with the Ultimates on several occasions. If the Ultimates were less violent, and Blackstar were less of a jerk, he’d consider applying for membership.
Appearance: Lodestone’s costume is gold and grey. The torso has a gold hourglass sort of pattern covering from his shoulders to his belt, and his half-face mask is gold as well. The legs, trunks, belt, sides, and arms are grey; the boots and gaunt- lets are gold.
Out of costume, William Huang is a handsome young man of Chinese descent. His hair is black and cut short, and his face often has an infectious grin... especially when he’s just made a big score and can afford to party.
