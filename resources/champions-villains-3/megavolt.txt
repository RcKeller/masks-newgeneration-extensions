Background/History: Curt Underwood was a high school dropout who worked as a deliveryman for an overnight delivery service. One day he was making his rounds during a severe thunderstorm when he lost control of his van and T-boned right into a chemical tanker at top speed. The tank ruptured, spilling some sort of chemical goo all over him through his broken windshield.
Terrified of catching cancer or something worse, Curt stumbled out of his wrecked van and into the storm, hoping the rain would wash him clean. Then he felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and there was a bright light, and suddenly a force like a huge, hot fist slammed him to the pavement. He blacked out.
When Curt woke up he was in the burn unit of the nearest hospital — that “fist” had been a lightning bolt that hit him in the shoulder and traveled through his body to exit out his foot. He had severe burns and a few other relatively mild injuries. The doctors hoped to send him home soon, but they were having trouble getting their instruments to work on him or give consistent readings.
Curt soon discovered what the problem was. He couldn’t sleep that evening and was tapping his finger on the metal railing on the side of his bed... when suddenly a tiny bolt of electricity arced out from his finger to the rail! A little experimentation showed that he could project bolts of lightning all the way across the room. He realized the lightning bolt had somehow given him superpowers, and that his body was emitting just enough electricity to cause interference with the medical instru- ments. It also occurred to him that he could use his powers to make a lot of money....
When the doctors came to Curt’s room in the morning, he wasn’t there. A few weeks later a new supervillain calling himself Megavolt made his debut with a daring daylight robbery of a jewelry store, and Curt’s supervillainous career was off and running. Everything went well until 2006, when Downshift and MeteorMan III of the California Patrol captured him. Sentenced to Stronghold,
he served three years before escaping during Menton’s 2009 breakout.
Personality/Motivation: Before his accident Curt Underwood wasn’t a particularly criminal person. Sure, he broke the speed limit a lot, and he liked to smoke pot, and he’d shoplifted a time or three, but he was basically an average guy. But the accident that gave him his superpowers also affected his mind, exacerbating his antisocial tendencies
while crippling his centers of compassion and reason. Now he’s thoroughly evil, concerned only with himself and his needs. Usually he just steals things, but sometimes he enjoys bullying people around with his powers (“Dance, little man!”) or destroying things just for fun.

Powers/Tactics: Megavolt has the power to project bolts and fields of electricity for various effects. In addition to standard “lightning blasts” in various configurations he can paralyze an enemy with DC current, protect himself with a “lightning shield,” and overload just about any electrical device.
In battle Megavolt usually opens with an Ionize attack, which makes his target vulnerable to his other attacks (and almost ensures he can score a hit if he puts his Combat Skill Levels in OCV, or lets him keep them all in DCV while still having
a good chance to hit). Then he follows up with Lightning Blasts and Bright Lightning Blasts, switching to Deadly if necessary. If his enemies bunch up too much, Ball Lightning or Controlled Chain Lightning let him hurt several of them at once.
Campaign Use: Megavolt can start his own schemes if you like, though he’s not powerful enough to take on most hero teams singlehand- edly; in most cases he works better as in an impromptu team with other villains or as a master villain’s hireling. If the PC team has an electricity- using hero, the two might become archnemeses.
To make Megavolt more powerful, convert his Multipower into an equivalent Variable Power Pool so he can wield a much broader range of electricity powers. To weaken him, reduce his REC to about 10-12 (so he has to be more careful about END usage), his DEX to 20-22, and his SPD to 5.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Ever since being captured by two heroes, Megavolt has wondered if there might be safety (and better profits!) in numbers. Arrowhead, a villain he met in Stronghold, has spoken to him about possibly forming a team, and he’s considering it.
Appearance: Megavolt is a white male, 5’8” tall with a slender build. His costume is navy blue with a yellow “burst of electricity” symbol on his chest. From this symbol lightning bolts run down his arms and legs to yellow gloves and boots.
His mask covers half his face, leaving his mouth exposed.


MEGAVOLT FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Megavolt if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Megavolt is a supervillain with electricity powers. Besides projecting bolts of electricity, he can paralyze foes with direct current, and protect himself with a “lightning shield.”
K/R: His real name is Curtis Underwood; he was in Stronghold from 2006 until the 2009 breakout.
-1: The “lightning shield” that Megavolt uses to protect himself from attacks is also dangerous to touch... or be touched by.
-6: Water-based attacks are particularly effective against Megavolt.
