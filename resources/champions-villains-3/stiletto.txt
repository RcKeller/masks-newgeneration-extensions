Background/History: Stiletto’s background is obscure. He first appeared as a supervillain in 1997, working sometimes as a solo thief and some- times as muscle-for-hire. His signature weapons, knives with blades made of questionite, were made for him by Wayland Talos. He worked frequently for VIPER. During an attack on an Angelstone Laboratories facility in Chicago in 2003, he and Dragon Branch member Tornado were captured by the Peacekeepers. Tornado was sentenced to Stronghold. Stiletto was initially sentenced to a ordinary maximum security prison, but after he nearly escaped three times and did escape once (only to be recaptured by the police) he was trans- ferred to Stronghold himself. He stayed there until 2009, when he broke free along with dozens of other inmates. After hiring Wayland Talos to make him some new questionite knives, he’s back on the supervillain-for-hire scene.
Personality/Motivation: Stiletto has a stub-
born, prideful attitude that got him into a lot
of trouble in Stronghold. Anything that even remotely resembles a challenge or an insult — someone staring at him a bit too long, an innocent comment he takes as disrespectful, another villain using something he wants to use — provokes him into an aggressive, confrontational mode that usually ends in a fight. When he’s “on the job”
he’s usually professional enough to keep his pride under control.
Quote: “Think you can take me, little man? I don’t need knives to carve you up.”
Powers/Tactics: Stiletto is a driven, highly-trained combatant whose signature weapons are fighting knives with questionite blades. They’re so sharp and durable that given time he can cut through nearly anything with them, including things like safe doors and brick walls that would resist ordi- nary blades. Even without his knives, Stiletto is a trained fighter and a tough guy. During his time in Stronghold he got a kick out of beating up villains who only know how to use their superpowers to fight.
Campaign Use: Stiletto’s origin has been left undefined so that you can connect him to a PC somehow. Perhaps he’s a hero’s brother, son, cousin, or love interest, for example.
To make Stiletto tougher, convert him into a low-powered “brick” with STR 30, CON 25, and PD/ED 12 with 6 points Resistant (+1⁄2) for each. You could also give him some Extra DCs with his Martial Arts. To weaken him, reduce his SPD to 4 and DEX and CON to 18.

Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: For someone who’s only been on the supervillain scene for about a decade, and spent a good chunk of that time behind bars, Stiletto’s made a lot of both friends and enemies. Tops on his “friends” list include VIPER (for whom he still does a lot of work; the organization’s tried to get him to join several times), Arrowhead (with whom he’s considering forming a team), and Wayland Talos (for whom, based on comments Talos has made, he once worked in some capacity). He’s also on good terms with some villains he’s partnered up with, such as Frag, Sunspot, and Utility.
His enemies list is even longer. Besides his main competitors in the super-mercenary field — villains like Hazard, Lazer, Mechassassin, Scimitar, and Steel Commando — there are plenty of now- escaped Stronghold inmates who hold a grudge against him for beating them up during confron- tations when they were incarcerated together. These include Boomslang, Requiem, Cheshire Cat, Fossil, Krait, and Thorn. Sooner or later one... or two or three... of these guys is likely to corner him in a dark alley and beat him to a pulp.
Appearance: Stiletto is a dark-haired white male 5’11” tall with hazel eyes. His costume is a black bodystocking with red boots and belt, and a red dagger chest emblem. He carries six knives with blades made of questionite: one on each of his upper arms with the hilt downward (so he can draw both simultaneously by crossing his arms); one on each of his hips; and one in each boot. The sheaths for the knives are red. He conceals his identity with a black half-face mask tied in the back; the eyeholes are sinisterly outlined in red


STILETTO FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Stiletto if they succeed with an appro- priate Skill Roll:
N/R: Stiletto is a super-mercenary whose trade- mark weapons are daggers with questionite blades (he carries half a dozen of them). He’s also a skilled fighter with just his fists.
K/R: His real name is Rick Stilson. From 2003 to 2009 he was imprisoned (for most of that time in Stronghold), and made plenty of enemies inside with his aggressive, macho attitude and love of showing superhumans that “they aren’t so tough when they can’t use their powers.”
-2: Stiletto has frequently worked for VIPER during his career.
-4: Stiletto may have some connection to Wayland Talos, who created his knives.
