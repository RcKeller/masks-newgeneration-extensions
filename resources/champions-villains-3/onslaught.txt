ONSLAUGHT
Background/History: Project Onslaught, one of the US Department of Defense’s efforts to create superhuman soldiers, has enjoyed one definite success — the now-deceased Janissary (see CU 42, 81) — and countless failures (of varying degrees). One man falls into both categories: the supervil- lain now known as Onslaught.
Mark Reed was a typical US Army soldier until the day some routine medical tests revealed that he was a candidate for the Onslaught program. He’d never amounted to much of anything in life, so the idea of getting superpowers appealed to him and he volunteered for the project. Months of work and often-painful procedures followed.
In the end the Onslaught regimen worked on him... in part. He was now superhumanly fast and strong, stronger even than the Janissary. But the treatments affected his mind as well, making him cold, callous, and cruel. After he nearly beat a technician to death for pricking him a little too hard with a needle, the brass in charge of Project Onslaught decided he was too unstable to use. They drugged him, chained him up in the back of a transport, and shipped him out to a top-secret Army detention facility.
Fortunately for Mark and unfortunately for
the world, the Project leaders underestimated his stamina and strength. He woke up from the drugs in mid-trip, snapped his chains, killed his guards, destroyed the truck, and escaped. He’s worked as a mercenary supervillain ever since.
Personality/Motivation: Onslaught is little more than a bully grown big, powerful, and unafraid. He lives for himself and only himself; he doesn’t give a damn about laws, other peoples’ feelings, or anything else that gets in the way of what he feels like doing. He loves to drink, brawl, carouse, raise hell, smash things, and create general havoc; one of his main complaints in life is that he can’t find people to keep up with him in these activities. But at least he can find employers willing to pay him to put his “talents” to good use.
Quote: “You hit pretty good, pal — for a little guy. Let’s see how well you can take a beating!”
Powers/Tactics: Onslaught is superhumanly strong and tough. He’s not as strong as most “bricks” in the Champions Universe, but he
makes up for it with his boxing training, the steel “knuckles” he wears on his hands, and general orneriness. He takes a “grab the bull by the horns” approach to combat — he picks out someone he thinks can give him a good fight (typically another brick) and charges him.

Campaign Use: Onslaught is an ideal henchman for any number of villains — not only because he’s relatively low-powered and thus easily ordered around, but because he’s got such low impulse control that he can serve the GM by accidentally blurting out clues and the like.
The best way to make Onslaught tougher is to literally make him tougher — that is, harder to hurt. Increase his Damage Negation to -8 or more DCs, or give him some Damage Reduction in addition; that way you end up with an adversary who isn’t necessarily as offensively powerful as the PCs but can still stand up to them a long time. To weaken him, remove his existing Damage Nega- tion, and consider getting rid of his Steel Knuckles and reducing his SPD to 4.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Onslaught intends to kill Turs al-Sh’ab (see page 303) whenever he gets the chance as revenge for Turs murdering Janissary in 2005. Onslaught didn’t know Janissary well, but they both got their powers from the same source and he feels like he owes it to him.
As a villain-for-hire, Onslaught’s mainly worked with VIPER and various mundane orga- nized crime groups who wanted some superpow- ered oomph for important jobs. He’s also occa- sionally joined the Brain Trust and the Crimelords to help out with crimes where his powers came in handy.
Appearance: Onslaught is a brute of a man, 6’8” tall and heavily muscled. His blonde hair is cut in short flat-top style. His costume consists of a black tanktop and pants, red boots and belt, and black fingerless gloves with studded red metal “knuckles” worn around the hand. He doesn’t wear a mask.
