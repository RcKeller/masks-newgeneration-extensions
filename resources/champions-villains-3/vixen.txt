Background/History: Like many little girls, Vicky Randolph grew up idolizing her father. Unlike most little girls, her father was a cat burglar. As she got older, she begged him to teach her the “family trade.” Reluctant at first, but seeing the benefits to having a partner, he finally agreed. Soon the father-and-daughter team was pulling down major scores in Amer- ican and Europe.
Then they made a mistake: they took a
job for VIPER. They knew it was a risk, but
the money involved was too good to pass up. After they did the job, the snakes paid up...
but in blood, not money. Not wanting to have any loose ends that might cause trouble later, VIPER took Victoria and her father captive and used them to test an experimental teleporta- tion device. VIPER’s scientists predicted there was only a 16.37% chance the subjects would survive. Sure enough, when the agents opened the door to the teleportation chamber, there was nothing left but a pile of organic dust that used to be two living human beings.
Or actually one living human being. For some reason, the device hadn’t worked on Victoria’s father, but it had worked on her. With a flash of blue-white light and a split-second of agonizing pain she found herself several miles away. Not being one to look a gift horse in the mouth, she fled and went into hiding. She soon discovered through the underworld grapevine that VIPER thought she, like her father, was dead.
And that wasn’t the only thing she discov- ered. A few days after her miraculous escape, she learned the teleporter had... altered her somehow. She could walk through walls! It wasn’t easy, and it tired her out quickly, but it was still amazing. And she seemed faster and more dexterous, too. Now she could become the most successful cat burglar ever!
But she decided she had other things to
do, too. There was the little matter of revenge. VIPER had kidnapped her and killed her father, so she was determined to destroy the organiza- tion. Wanting to keep the secret of her survival from VIPER as long as possible, she created the costumed identity of Vixen and embarked on a career of thievery and snake-baiting.
Personality/Motivation: Compared to most of the villains the heroes fight, Vixen is pretty admi- rable. Sure, she’s greedy, and she doesn’t have much respect for the property of others, but she has no interest in hurting anyone (well, anyone not associated with VIPER, anyway). She’s smart, pleasant to talk to, appreciates the finer things in life, and has an impish wit. From some perspectives her crusade against VIPER might even make her seem like a quasi-hero, but her unreasoning hatred for the organization could easily push her to do things that she’d otherwise never consider, like putting lives at risk.

When dealing with people she likes but doesn’t necessarily trust or want to let get too close to
her (i.e., the PCs), Vixen tends to adopt a sort of “flirtatious” attitude (at least toward the men). She finds this puts people off-guard and gives her an advantage. When flirting, she often adopts a slight French accent and refers to the people as “cherie.”
Quote: “Now, cherie, I hope you didn’t think even you could catch me that easily.”
Powers/Tactics: Compared to an average person, Vixen is quite competent: She’s fast, agile, skilled, and knows karate. But she’s gotten the idea in her head that being able to become intangible for a few seconds makes her a “superhuman” on par with the likes of the Champions, which just isn’t so. In a superbattle she’s likely to find herself in over her head pretty quickly if she doesn’t watch what she’s doing.
Campaign Use: Vixen is intended as a quasi-ally and perhaps even potential romantic interest
for your heroes more than a true supervillain. While she is a thief with an overwhelming love
of the finer things in life, she’s not evil and could definitely be redeemed... with the help of the
right hero, of course! Overcoming her desire for revenge against VIPER might be harder, but it would be possible to channel it so that she’s not so reckless or unconcerned with the consequences of her schemes against the snakes.
To make Vixen more powerful, remove the Limitations on her Desolidification, and perhaps give her some related powers (such as DCV Combat Skill Levels defined as “blink Desolidifica- tion”). To weaken her, reduce her DEX to 20 and SPD to 5, and get rid of her Overall Levels.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Vixen hates VIPER with all her heart and soul and is deter- mined to destroy it. She won’t take foolish risks, but she’ll do anything else she can to expose VIPER’s plots, get its agents arrested, and steal from it.
Vixen usually prefers to pull jobs on her own, but she has teamed with GRAB a time or two and enjoyed it. She’d consider joining the group if they made her an offer... provided they agreed to help her fight VIPER.
Appearance: Victoria Randolph is a white woman, 5’10” tall with an attractive, well-developed figure. Her shoulder-length hair is chestnut brown, her eyes green, and her face pretty enough to have graced the covers of a thousand magazines had she chosen to become a fashion model. As Vixen she wears a reddish-orange (i.e., fox-colored) bodystocking with reddish-brown gloves, boots, and flared domino-style mask.
