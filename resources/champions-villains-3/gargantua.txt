GARGANTUA
Background/History: Thomas Russell was big, even as a kid — so big he killed his mother when she gave birth to him. By the time he was four years old, he was the size of a ten-year-old; at twelve he was as tall and muscled as a full-grown man. It didn’t take long for him to learn he could push the other children around and bully them. With his size, he rarely had to hit anyone, the threat of it was enough. Even his teachers were a little scared of him.
By the time he was a teenager, Russell discov- ered there was more to his size than met the eye: he could alter it, growing even bigger and stronger for short periods of time. The more he practiced with this power, the taller he got and the longer he could maintain the effect. But he wasn’t as stupid as he was big. He didn’t have any intention of using his powers “for the good of all mankind”; he was going to use them for himself, and himself alone. To do that he had to keep them secret.
Russell’s size and muscle soon attracted the attention of the local VIPER Nest, which recruited him as an agent-in-training. He enjoyed the expe- rience, even learning a thing or two about being a cat burglar, but quickly decided it wasn’t for him. Following orders and being part of a private army just wasn’t what he had in mind for himself.
It wasn’t long after Russell finished high school that a new costumed criminal, calling himself Gargantua, appeared on the scene. At first he worked mainly for VIPER, but after a couple
of years he branched out, pulling solo jobs and teaming up with other villains and organizations. Since then he’s built a reputation as a powerful, dependable, professional super-criminal. He’s made a lot of money and had a great time fighting superheroes, and he plans to be around for a long, long time.
Personality/Motivation: For a supervillain, particularly a super-strong one, Gargantua is intel- ligent and thoughtful, even philosophical. He’s no dummy, and it angers him when people treat him as if he is (especially when they simply assume that “he’s strong, so he can’t be bright”). He never went to college, but he enjoys reading “deep books” and discussing them, a trait that earns him a measure of respect from master villains who ordinarily dismiss the “hired help” as morons.

Gargantua’s size, strength, and experiences as a supervillain have given him a healthy dose of overconfidence. He has yet to suffer a serious defeat or significant injury, and at this point practically thinks he’s invulnerable. He’ll take on anyone or anything.
Quote: “Ready to be crushed, little man?”
Powers/Tactics: Gargantua’s powers derive from his ability to grow to tremendous heights (at his maximum, 64m, or about 200 feet, tall). Generally he can only use his full Growth outdoors and on other strong surfaces, since otherwise his weight makes him crash through floors and get stuck in small spaces (though he does enjoy using all his Growth at once to “explode” a building from the inside out). Because his Growth is Constant and he uses it so much, he only gets a -1⁄4 value for the Linked Limitation on his associated abilities.
But that’s not the limit of his abilities. His training as a thief gives him capabilities most big, strong villains lack (though usually he can only use them when he’s at or near normal human size; in particular, the PER Roll bonuses to see him when he’s Grown tend to make Stealth pointless).
Gargantua is intelligent, and fights that way.
In combat the first thing he does is try to get to a place where he can use his full Growth powers (or as much of them as possible); that usually means taking the fight outside. When he’s ready, he’ll pick out the enemy he’s most capable of dealing with (usually another “brick,” or a flying character other people have trouble hitting), and smash him. If he can’t simply crush someone with his gargantuan fists, he’ll pick that person up and throw him as far as he can, hopefully removing him from the battle. Although he’s not a ruthless killer he’s willing to put other people in danger to distract superheroes; one of his favorite such tactics is to pick up a bus or a building and throw it just far enough that a super-strong hero can get to it in time to catch it and save the people inside.
Campaign Use: Gargantua is a change of pace from the usual brick, and should be played that way. Not only does his enormous size give him certain abilities most bricks lack, but he doesn’t mindlessly smash his enemies. He fights cleverly, with a good head for tactics. Similarly, he’s not easy to trick or manipulate; he knows full well what he can do, and what his services are worth, and doesn’t take risky or pointless jobs.

If Gargantua is too weak for your game, increase his Damage Reduction to 50% and increase his normal STR and CON (so that he’s able to hold his own better in situations where he can’t use his Growth). Some Mental Defense and Power Defense may also be called for. If he’s too tough, scale back on the Growth, and the Charac- teristics and abilities Linked to it — 30-45 points’ worth of Growth and associated abilities may work better for you.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Gargantua is one of the most consistent, reliable merce-
nary supervillains on the market, so he’s become something of a “go-to guy” for master villains and groups that need a temporary infusion of major muscle. He’s not cheap — he’s very aware of his value — but he’s worth every nickel. Employers he’s worked with (or partnered with) include VIPER (his first, and most common, employer), ARGENT, Holocaust, the Warlord, the Brain Trust, Cirque Sinister, the Ultimates (though Blackstar hates him for laughing off Blackstar’s challenges to fight), Ankylosaur, Foxbat, Howler, Shrinker, and Vector.
Kinematik has approached Gargantua about joining his pro-mutant crusade. Gargantua’s made it quite clear he’s not interested, so Kinematik wisely decided to back off... for now.
Anytime VIPER hires Gargantua and teams him up with Ripper (a pairing that terrifies even experienced superhero teams), the two of them have a friendly arm-wrestling contest, loser buys drinks. So far Gargantua leads 4 to 2. Ripper’s determined to take the lead somehow!
Appearance: Gargantua’s costume consists of a brown and green high-collared jacket-like top, brown pants, green gloves and boots, and a brown half-face mask that leaves his dirty blonde hair and short beard visible. At normal size, he’s 7’1” tall and massively built.
