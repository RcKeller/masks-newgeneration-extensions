Background/History: In 1968, a lonely old
woman went outside one morning and found that someone had left a baby on her doorstep. There was something wrong with it — the baby appeared malformed or crippled, with arms and facial features that weren’t fully formed. Moved to pity, the woman took the baby in and raised it herself.
Oddly, as the baby aged, its features became more and more precise. By the time the child was old enough to walk and talk, it was apparent that he/she wasn’t a normal human — he/she had the power to change shape. One day, he/she was a girl, the next day a boy, the day after that a disturbing blend of male and female features... whatever seemed to catch the child’s fancy at the moment. Terrified, but unwilling to abandon a child she’d come to love, the woman raised him/her as best she could, trying to teach him/her to use his/ her abilities. She kept the child with her, home schooling him/her until he/she was old enough to understand the nature and implication of his/her powers and why he/she shouldn’t use them casu- ally in public.


The child continued to grow, now mingling with other people, but feeling no connection
with or interest in them. He/she learned he/she could flawlessly imitate anyone’s appearance, and derived much pleasure from using this power to get his/her classmates in serious trouble. As he/ she got older, he/she realized he/she could use his/ her abilities to make money — lots of money — in all sorts of ways. He/she started with petty theft and con games, and soon began to commit more serious crimes. The first time he/she was nearly caught, he/she had to kill a man to keep his/
her secret, and found this no more disturbing or upsetting than his/her juvenile mischief-making.
The day he/she graduated from high school, his/her “mother” died, leaving him/her alone
in the world. But he/she didn’t care; by then he/ she had made connections with organized crime and was earning real money. Soon the CIA got word of him/her, and he/she made entry into the world of espionage. After a few years working for the CIA, just for the experience, he/she betrayed his/her handlers (arranging their deaths in the process) and became a freelance spy commanding the highest fees. In certain rarified and dangerous circles, the person called Masquerade has become known as one of the most skilled and deadly agents in the world, the one to turn to when no one else can get the job done.
Personality/Motivation: Although at least nomi- nally human, Masquerade feels no more sympathy, compassion, or mercy for his/her “fellow” humans than a shark does for lesser fish. His/her powers and attitude disconnect him/her from other people, making it easy for him/her to commit the most heinous and bloody crimes without feeling so much as a twinge of guilt. He/she enjoys using his/her powers and skills to inflict casual cruelties on others, ranging from verbal abuse, to inter- fering with jobs and credit ratings, to breaking up romantic relationships. As good an actor as he/she is, he/she often trips him/herself up because he/ she can’t resist the opportunity to work some petty evil just for fun.
Despite this trait, Masquerade has learned to follow the code of the mercenary. He/she might be the best spy in the world, but if employers don’t trust him/her, he/she won’t get any work. Loyalty to his/her employers has done as much to cement his/her reputation as his/her matchless infiltration abilities.
Quote: “Good morning, Senator. Here’s what’s on your schedule for today....”
Powers/Tactics: A highly skilled assassin and spy, Masquerade possesses the ability to alter his/ her shape to any other humanoid form. He/she has no defined gender or appearance; he/she has never defined a “true shape” that he/she returns to in times of relaxation — he/she simply changes shape the way other people change clothes. His/ her change works right down to the cellular level, making it possible for him to trick fingerprint checks, retina scanners, and DNA tests.


Appearance:
Masquerade can have any appearance he/
she desires — man or woman, young or old, rich or poor, healthy
or ill. Indeed, he/she
can change his/her appearance from second to second, as he/she chooses.

MASQUERADE FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Masquerade if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Masquerade is a supervillain with the ability to assume any humanoid shape. He can flawlessly imitate another person’s appearance right down to the cellular/ genetic level, making it impos- sible for him to trick nearly any sort of security system.
K/R: Masquerade scares many government and business officials nearly as much as Menton does.
-2: Half of the governments and corporations in the world seem to want to hire Masquerade; the other half secretly offer substantial rewards to anyone who kills him.
-10: Masquerade has no true form (or gender); he/she is some sort of natural shape-changer.


When he/she assumes another person’s form, all he/she lacks is that person’s memories and person- ality, which he/she can usually imitate or bluff his/ her way through with Acting. (He/she also cannot imitate superpowers, unless he/she uses technology prepared in advance.)
Masquerade’s skills include hand-to-hand combat and weapons use, plus the ability to turn any sharp or hard object into a lethal attack, but he/ she prefers to avoid open combat. He/she has the advantage in situations where he/she can trick, fool, and confuse people, not on the battlefield.
Campaign Use: Although he/she’s not necessarily the most skilled combatant, and certainly lacks the raw power of a Dr. Destroyer or a Takofanes, Masquerade is justifiably considered a tremendous security threat by every nation, organization, and corporation on the planet. Able to assume any human form flawlessly right down to the cellular level, he/she can infiltrate almost any installation, obtain almost any information, and compromise almost any security. If there’s anyone who scares politicians as much as Menton, it’s Masquerade.
You should use Masquerade carefully in scenarios. He/she isn’t much fun if he/she simply walks away with the prize and the heroes never have a chance to stop him/her. Unless the PCs
at least suspect his/her presence or involve-
ment, you’re not getting as much mileage out of the character as you can. But at the same time,
the PCs mustn’t have too easy a time uncovering Masquerade; it should require some effort and clever roleplaying. The best way to trip him/her up is with knowledge he/she lacks, but he/she can also be detected with Mental Senses (he/she can’t change her brainwaves or mental thought patterns).
Masquerade doesn’t have a “Secret Identity” because he/she has no defined “true identity” — and even if he/she did, finding out any informa- tion about it would be next to impossible (barring the use of Mental Powers). Since he/she suffers no significant restrictions because of his/her “secret,” he/she’s not entitled to a Complication for it. However, the story of where he/she came from, who his/her parents are, and the source of his/her powers could make for interesting plot points the GM can exploit.
To make Masquerade more powerful, give him/ her a Mimic Power Pool so he/she can imitate superheroes’ powers, or Mental Powers so he/
she can copy other peoples’ memories as well. To make him/her less powerful, decrease the useful- ness of his/her Shape Shift — get rid of some Sense Groups, or make changes take a long time. You can also add or remove Skills.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: In recent years Masquerade has done a lot of work for an unidenti- fied, but high-paying, member of the US govern- ment. Unbeknownst to him/her (his/her code of professionalism demands he/she not try to find out who he is unless he gives him/her reason to distrust him), this person is Representative David Suther- land — the supervillain Invictus (see CV1). He/She has also, with knowledge of whom he/she’s working for, been employed by Franklin Stone and Slun.
