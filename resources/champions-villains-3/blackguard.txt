BLACKGUARD
Background/History: From a July, 2005 interview of Blackguard by the Villainy Unbound website during one of his brief periods of incarceration:
“My “secret origin?” Not much to tell, really, mate. I wasn’t exactly whatcha’d call an altar boy as a kid — I got into all kinds’a trouble. Shopliftin’, joyridin’, vandalism, whatever seemed like fun. Then ’long about puberty I began to get real sick a lot, and the doctors couldn’t figure out why. It passed after a year or so, and suddenly I went from bein’ a scrawny kid to incredibly strong and tough. Someone told me later that I’m one’a those “mutants” ya read about in th’ papers. Makes no difference to me. All I know is that now I can get into a lot more kinds of trouble and have a lot more fun.”
Personality/Motivation: Blackguard is mostly a happy-go-lucky, enjoy life and what it brings you, let’s-have-a-lotta-fun kind of guy. Compared to many villains he’s pretty lighthearted. He just loves doing whatever he pleases, having fun, taking risks, and getting into fights — especially the latter. He’s found out the best way to live life the way he wants to is to be a supervillain, so that’s what he does.
Despite the fact that he steals and commits acts of violence for a living, Blackguard is an up-front guy. If he gives his word, he keeps it, no matter what it takes. If he makes a promise, he’ll go to Hell and back to keep it. Sometimes he annoys his employers this way, but since this trait also makes him an extremely loyal hireling they can usually overlook any problems it causes.
Blackguard typically affects a mild British accent and speech patterns, but he was born in New Jersey.
Quote: “’Ey! I think you’re askin’ for a bruising, mate — and I’m just the fella t’ give it to ya.”
Powers/Tactics: Blackguard is a brawler par excellence. His mutant powers make him much stronger than normal humans, and much more resilient. Hurting him, and keeping him down when you knock him down, is very difficult. In group fights Blackguard’s often the last villain standing even when other, much more powerful, villains have fallen. Although he’s got a fairly good sense of tactics, usually he just picks the target that looks the toughest and begins fighting. He particularly enjoys taking on foes who can give as good as they get, such as most bricks.
Although he loves to fight, Blackguard isn’t really a killer. He’d use lethal force if he had to, but most of the time he’s content to leave his oppo- nents soundly beaten and unconscious.

BLACKGUARD FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Blackguard if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Blackguard is a supervillain with low-level super- human strength. However, he’s incredibly tough, and recovers from attacks and injuries rapidly.
K/R: His real name is Blake Harrison; he’s a former petty crook.
-2: Blackguard is a mutant.
-4: Although he’s a criminal, Blackguard is in some respects an honorable person — if he gives his word, he keeps it no matter what it takes.
-8: Despite his British accent and speech patterns, Blackguard was born and raised in New Jersey.

Campaign Use: Blackguard makes a good henchmen or hireling for any number of villains, and perhaps a good archnemesis or Rival for a hero with a similar penchant for fighting. He also works well as a mainstay of a group of villains because of his resilience. On the other hand, if you want to exaggerate his faux Britishness he could become a comedic villain along the lines of Bulldozer or Foxbat.
To make Blackguard tougher, increase his STR to 40-50 and his SPD to 6. To weaken him, reduce his REC to 30 and his Damage Reduction to 50%.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Black- guard’s worked for or with a number of villains (including the Ultimates, VIPER, the Crimelords, and Mechassassin) and gets along well with most of them. Many villains find him a pleasure to work with, given how emotionally unstable so many villains are. One notable exception is Green Dragon; he and Blackguard have traded insults and blows several times. He’s also got a rivalry going with Bulldozer through various websites and magazines, though they haven’t yet fought to determine who’s the better man.
Blackguard has worked with Kinematik and is sympathetic to his pro-mutant cause, but for now doesn’t want to join up full-time. Kinema- tik’s looking for ways to change his mind, such as engineering a run of “bad luck” or setbacks that convinces Blackguard he needs friends he can always rely on.
Appearance: Blackguard is a handsome white man, 6’2” tall with the muscular build of a brawler and athlete. His hair is flowing and black, and he has a matching short black beard and moustache. He wears a black shirt, brown pants, and black leather boots and belt. He doesn’t wear gloves or
a mask.
