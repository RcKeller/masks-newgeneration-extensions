GALAXIA
Background/History: Long ago, perhaps even before the Multiverse existed, the Cosmic Gems came into existence. Some say there are three Gems, some say 15, some other numbers in between. No one — not the Malvans, not the Elder Worm, not even CONTROL and the Overseers of Odrugar — knows the true origin and nature of the Cosmic Gems. It’s thought the Galaxars (see CU 150) may know, but if so they’ve said nothing.
What is known is that a Cosmic Gem confers vast powers on the person who possesses it. (Whether the Gems are intelligent and choose their possessors is a matter of speculation, as is just how much of a Gem’s power a possessor can unlock.) Beings eager for power have sought one or another of the Gems for centuries, but few who actively seek them succeed in their quest.
One of the few beings who possesses a Cosmic Gem is the “woman” called Galaxia, whose homeworld and native species are unknown.
For decades, perhaps centuries, she cut a swath across the civilized regions of the Milky Way, conquering, destroying, and fighting as the mood took her. But eventually the civilized species tired of her depredations and came against her with a force of starships too great for even her to handle. She fled...
...and soon her travels brought her to a cosmic backwater known as the Sol system. She’d heard of it; this was the system with the world that had so many powered beings. What better challenge for her, and better place to hide from her enemies, than Earth?
Personality/Motivation: Galaxia is a classical megalomaniacal conqueror. She knows just how powerful she is, and she believes it’s her destiny to rule whatever she feels like ruling and do whatever she feels like doing. Anyone who tries to stop her earns the full measure of her wrath.
Beyond that, analyzing Galaxia’s psychology
is difficult because she’s not only not Human, no one knows exactly what species she is. (Appar- ently the Cosmic Gem either makes her look like the observer’s species, or it allowed her to choose her appearance and she selected something very close to Human.) Therefore it’s difficult to say what might be completely ordinary behavior for her, and what’s out of the ordinary.
Quote: “Cosmic storms cannot stop me! The Malvans cannot stop me! What hope have you of stopping me, foolish Human?”

Powers/Tactics: Galaxia fights in a bold, aggres- sive fashion (often accompanying her actions
with Presence Attacks) as a way of impressing and intimidating her opponents. She starts a battle from a distance, relying on the generally greater range of her attacks to get in a few blows before her opponents can counterattack. She favors her Standard and Mental Blasts, but is quick to shift to a Deadly Blast if an opponent irritates her.
Campaign Use: Galaxia’s background provides at least one major plot for the GM to exploit: who exactly is she running from, how close are they to catching up to her, and what will happen when then do? An epic space battle near Earth could be dangerous for humanity....
Galaxia should be tough enough to take on your heroes by herself, at least for a little while. If that’s not the case, increase her abilities until she can — perhaps give her some Damage Reduc- tion, a Barrier, more CON, SPD, and/or STUN, or the like. If she’s already too tough, reduce her Multipower to a 105-point reserve and all slots accordingly, and perhaps reduce her defenses and SPD slightly.
Appearance: Galaxia looks like a slender, well- proportioned, beautiful human female with dark hair reaching down to her midback. Her costume is a royal blue with gold boots and highlights.
In the center of her forehead is an oval-shaped, smooth gemstone that’s usually red, but can shift colors or show multiple colors at once. It often glows or is surrounded by a corona of energy.


GALAXIA FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Galaxia if they succeed with an appro- priate Skill Roll:
N/R: Galaxia is a powerful being from outer space who wields a super-weapon called the Cosmic Gem. She’s extremely dangerous and destructive. Although she looks Human, she’s not; no one’s sure what species she comes from.
-2: Galaxia’s purpose in the region of space near Earth is unknown, though based on the available information she seems to have fled (and perhaps to still be fleeing) a coalition of civilized races that are trying to capture or destroy her.
-6: Galaxia’s weapon isn’t the Cosmic Gem, it’s a Cosmic Gem — there are more of them, though no one’s sure how many. The Galaxars may know more, but if so they’re not talking.
