EXO
Background/History: I’m gonna get away this time I’m gonna get away this time no way them fat cops can catch me lead I got... He glanced back over his shoulder to make sure that was still true.
“Going somewhere?” an electronically modu- lated voice suddenly asked from in front of him. He whipped his head around just in time to run smack into Defender.
When he woke up he was in the hospital, hand- cuffed to the bed, with a cop nearby watching him. Damn, busted again... and all ’cause’a that armored freak. When I get outta here I’m gonna show him who’s better.
Unfortunately for the world, Roy Jannick’s intelligence was the equal of his male pride. He decided he was going to build himself a suit
of armor that would let him get revenge on Defender, and by God and by gumption he did it. It took years of night school and more than a few robberies to pay for the parts and tools, but he did it. ’Course, he didn’t have enough money for a full armored suit, so he had to make an exoskeleton, but so what? Still better than that trash Defender got on. Now we’ll see who smacks who around....
Personality/Motivation: Exo is so full of male pride and the need to prove that he’s “better” than someone else that he actually turned his
life around, leaving petty crime behind to teach himself enough science to make a powered exoskeleton. If he didn’t use his gifts and exoskel- eton to commit crimes, he’d be lauded as an amazing success story. As it is, some members
of the Superhuman World laugh at him (which infuriates him and makes him all the more determined to prove himself), while others worry that someone with his talents could become really dangerous in time if not stopped now.
Quote: “Yeah, bring it on, jerk! When I’m done pounding you into the ground you won’t be so smug.”
Powers/Tactics: Exo wears a powered exoskel- eton of his own design. While not as protective or powerful as a true powered armor suit, it makes him plenty strong and tough enough to commit all sorts of supercrimes — mainly smash-and- grab robberies of targets no ordinary robber could easily take down. But as much as he loves money, he likes fighting and proving how good his suit is even more. He usually opens with
an Armor Piercing Blast (or maybe an Explo- sion against multiple targets), then keeps up the Ranged attacks until he can close to HTH Combat distance and administer a sound thrashing with his Electrified Gauntlets.

Campaign Use: If a way can be found around his touchy male pride, Exo is potentially redeemable. He’s plenty greedy, but he’s not a truly violent or dangerous person compared to the majority of supervillains. Given the right coaxing and incen- tive he could “switch sides” to fight with the white hats.
To make Exo tougher, increase the strength of his Force-Field and/or add a few weapons to his suit (maybe a laser [RKA] or a shoulder-mounted rack of mini-missiles). To weaken him, reduce his SPD to 4 and the dice in his Blast to 8d6.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Exo’s seen pictures of Frag on the news and think’s she’s hot. He’s never met her but hopes he’ll get the chance when they work for the same employer or she recruits him as part of one of her gangs.
Appearance: Exo is a 5’10” tall black male with
a moderately athletic build. The exoskeleton that gives him his powers consists of a chestpiece that fits over the upper chest, a heavy belt, gauntlets, boots, and a skullcap-like helmet that covers the top half of his head. High-tech cables and struts connect these parts to one another; the cables and struts are close to the body, not dangling or loose.

EXO FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Exo if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Exo is a villain who wears a suit of super-tech exoskeleton that augments his strength and reflexes and is also equipped with several weapons (including a configurable blaster, electrified gauntlets, and a tangleweb projector).
K/R: His real name is Roy Jannick; he’s a former petty criminal.
-1: Although he’s a macho trash-talker who enjoys showing off his powers, Exo isn’t inherently violent or vicious, and in fact has sometimes gone out of his way to avoid seriously harming his opponents or innocent bystanders.
-6: Exo can “power up” the force-field his exoskeleton generates to a very high degree of protection, but this creates a severe drain on the suit’s power pack.
