Background/History: Approximately 600 years ago, there lived a devout Taoist monk named Li Chun. His piety, wisdom, martial arts skill, and magical powers were known far and wide, and many disciples came to study at his small temple in the wilds of Yunnan Province.
One day some of the students came to Li Chun’s room to assist him with his morning routine, as was their duty. Much to their surprise, their master was missing! A search of the temple and the surrounding area found Li Chun in a nearby cave, meditating and staring at the wall. Mindful of the tales of the master Bodhidharma, who meditated and stared at a cave wall for
nine years, the disciples left their master to his devotions.
And so it went for several years, with the monks tending to the business of the temple and their studies while Li Chun devoted himself to his meditations. Then a marauding gang of bandits swept down upon the temple to loot it of its treasures. The terrified monks fled for their lives, completely forgetting their master in the process. Such is the measure of a weak man’s loyalty in the face of adversity.
The bandits looted and wrecked the temple, but they never found Li Chun. In fact, no one found Li Chun, for his disciples never returned and he was soon forgotten by a populace intent
on daily survival. But Li Chun was still alive, and he was not meditating. Ever since the morning
his students first found him in the cave, he’d been engaged in a battle with a fearsome demonic entity that wanted to take over his body and use his magical powers to wreak havoc. For a dozen years, and a dozen after that, and yet a third dozen, Li Chun strove to drive away the demon and keep the people safe.
Victory was not, however, to be his in the end. For all his powers, Li Chun was only a man, and without sustenance and comfort no man can with- stand the indefatigable attacks of the evil entities that come from the Realms of the Yama Kings. Li Chun’s defenses finally collapsed and the demonic being possessed him. But it did not possess him completely: as his last, desperate act, Li Chun cast his body into a trance so deep and so strong that not even the demon could break it. The demon was trapped in an earthly shell, unable to move or use its own powers to escape.
Over the centuries Li Chun’s body slept. The nearby temple finally collapsed, and Li Chun slept. Generations were born, had children of their
own, and died, and Li Chun slept. Dynasties fell and rose, and still Li Chun slept. Within him the demon screamed, driven insane by the torment of its imprisonment.

Eventually the last of the dynasties collapsed, and a new form of government came to China. But it did not last, and soon the Communists took over the Middle Kingdom. During the Sixties, a team of Communist archaeologists and anthro- pologists working on Peking’s behalf uncovered Li Chun’s ancient temple and noted it on a list of sites for potential exploration or destruction, as their Communist masters willed. These men gave Li Chun, no longer a gentle Taoist monk but a being of fearsome evil power, the key to unlock the gates of slumber. One of them chanced too close to Li Chun’s cave looking for other temple buildings and had the misfortune to be mauled to death by an unknown wild animal — or so his comrades thought.

Appearance: Li Chun the Destroyer resembles a short, bald, middle-aged Taoist monk. He wears simple brown robes. However, the fact that he’s been possessed by a demon and the power that he wields are obvious to anyone who looks at him: his face appears oddly distorted or distended, his eyes are solid blood-red, and energy sometimes crackles around him.

In truth, the demonic thing that was now
Li Chun had finally achieved a sufficient level
of power to perform some minor acts despite the trance Li Chun had imposed upon it. As if dreaming, he sensed the nearby life-force of the archaeologist, and summoned one of his lesser brethren to slay the human gnat. The human’s dissipating life force and blood gave the demonic being more power, enough to slowly cast off


the chains Li Chun had set upon him. Nearly three decades it took the demon to free himself completely, but in 1995 his task was at long last complete. He emerged from the cave, looked about, and grinned with pleasure. Then his rampage of destruction began. The Tiger Squad responded, and after at two-day running battle the Chinese superteam succeeded only in driving Li Chun the Destroyer away. Where he went, and when he will return, no one knows...
...except for Doctor Yin Wu (see CV3). Regarding Li Chun as both a threat and a potential tool, he cast a spell that transported the demonic being to the Yama Realms against his will and trapped him there. Doctor Wu intends to leave him there until he finds a way to control him, and thus use him for his (Dr. Wu’s) own inscrutable ends. But beings as powerful as Li Chun have a knack for determining their own destinies....
Personality/Motivation: The thing that was once the Taoist monk Li Chun is now a human shell motivated by a demonic being of unknown nature and powers — and what’s worse, a demon driven mad by centuries of helpless captivity in a human body. He’s thoroughly and utterly evil, intent only on destruction, mayhem, murder, and fulfillment of his lusts. If not stopped, he’ll do its best to destroy the world and all of the human insects that inhabit it.
Quote: “Insects will be squashed.”
Powers/Tactics: Li Chun the Destroyer can make use of his host body’s martial arts prowess and some of its own demonic powers, mainly those relating to deception and confusion, as well as certain innate demonic abilities (such as resis- tance to injury). Fast, strong, and cruel, he uses whatever ability is most likely to psychologically or physically harm his enemies, and he shows no mercy. Insane from centuries of imprisonment, Li Chun begins his attacks on mankind as orgies of destruction, only turning to deception and subterfuge when he’s satisfied his bloodlust.
There’s almost nothing left of Li Chun himself inside his own body. It would take an incredible amount of mystical or mental power simply to contact the last remaining spark of his essence, and an even greater amount to somehow free that spark. But he can never reclaim his body — it’s too far gone into corruption.
Campaign Use: Li Chun is intended to take on entire groups of PCs, either subtly or in a knock- down-drag-out fight. If he cannot fulfill this role in your campaign, beef him up or change him so he can.
If you need to make Li Chun stronger, you have plenty of options. As he becomes accustomed to its body, he’ll likewise become able to use more of Li Chun’s magical Taoist powers. He’ll also be able to use more of his demonic abilities (such as the power to create bolts of flame even more destruc- tive than his Demonic Blast). These abilities are most likely to emerge in combat, particularly when Li Chun has gone Berserk.


LI CHUN THE DESTROYER FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Li Chun the Destroyer if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Li Chun is an immensely powerful mystic, perhaps demonic, entity who attacked China in 1995 and held the entire Tiger Squad at bay for two days of rampant destruction, then vanished. He hasn’t been seen since.
K/R: Li Chun’s powers include not only great strength and martial arts prowess, but various mental and demonic powers including firing blasts of energy or psionic force, creating illu- sions, transforming people into insects, and teleporting.
-8: Exposure to human saliva or to salt causes Lic Chun great pain.
-10: Li Chun is currently trapped
in the Yama Realms (the Chinese hells) by Dr. Yin Wu, who’s trying to find a way to control and use him.
