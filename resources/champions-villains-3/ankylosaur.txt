ANKYLOSAUR
11
Appearance: Anky- losaur wears a suit of steel grey powered armor patterned after the dinosaur of the same name. Sharp spikes stud the shoulders, gaunt- lets, helmet, and other parts of it, and it has an artificial tail, with a large spiked knob on the end. The tail functions as a grenade launcher as well as a way to smash superheroes; it projects from the bottom of a backpack-like structure on his back which holds the grenades.
Out of his armor, Paul Bressler is only 5’8” tall (as opposed to 6’3” in it). He has dirty brown hair, watery green eyes, and the beginnings of a gin blossom. He dresses like a man with a lot more money than taste.
  Background/History: How lucky can one guy get? All his life, Paul Bressler couldn’t get a break.
He was born into a poor family where no one really understood him. He got expelled from school because of a tiny misunderstanding about what he and the principal’s daughter were doing. He got tossed into juvie for just a little joyriding and a couple of burglaries. Nothing ever turned out right. But the way Paul figured it, sooner or later he was due for a big break to make up for all the rotten luck.
One day, the local VIPER Nest hired Paul, his buddy John MacDougal, and some of their other pals to help out with a job. Paul figured this was his big break — a chance to get in good with VIPER! He was right, but not in the way he expected.
Paul and his friends had a simple part to play. All they needed to do was make a lot of noise and stage a diversion outside one of UNTIL’s research facilities so the VIPER teams could infiltrate the place and steal some stuff. Piece a’ cake, right? Wrong. UNTIL responded more quickly, and with more force, than VIPER expected. Paul and John panicked, running into the facility instead of away from it, and once inside quickly became separated.

Quote: “Ready for a pounding, hero?”
Powers/Tactics: Ankylosaur’s powers come entirely from the powered armor suit he stole from UNTIL, and later had Wayland Talos re-create; without the suit, Paul Bressler’s little more than a garden-variety street thug. In addition to its defensive capabilities, the suit enhances his strength and reflexes and comes equipped with a combination artificial tail/ grenade launcher which fires several different types of explosive missiles. The suit also augments his strength, particularly when he’s using the tail.
At the start of a battle, Ankylosaur mainly relies on grenades, hoping to take out as many enemies as possible (besides, it’s fun to blow stuff up). When the melee gets too mixed for grenades, he leaps into the fray and starts battering heroes into submission with his tail (or claws, if he’s feeling vicious). He enjoys a good fight, and won’t back down even from a serious challenge, but if the situation becomes hopeless he’s got no qualms about making a break for it.
The Ankylosaur armor is unusually susceptible to Sonic attacks, which cause the wearer painful feedback via its cybernetic controls. Wayland Talos is working on a way around this problem, but hasn’t solved it yet.
Campaign Use: Ankylosaur is a perfect merce- nary villain when you need to provide another supercriminal with some backup, or form an impromptu team of solo bad guys. He’s a born follower. And who knows what might have happened to John MacDougal or any of the other friends he was with that night? He hasn’t heard from them since or been able to find out anything. Obviously there was something mighty strange going on at that UNTIL lab....
If Ankylosaur’s not tough enough to stand up to your heroes, boost his STR by 10-20 and his SPD by 1-2; give him some more grenades, too, if other types of attacks will help. On the other hand, if he’s too tough, scale down the extra STR when using his Tail, and get rid of one or two types of grenades.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: As a some- times-mercenary villain, Ankylosaur has worked with a wide variety of other villains either as a hireling or a partner. For example, he’s on good terms with Holocaust, the Ultimates, and VIPER. (However, the latter might turn against him if
it ever learned he first acquired his armor while in its employ.) He doesn’t get along with Pulsar (whom he considers an arrogant blowhard), and once had a contract with ARGENT that ended badly so he won’t work for it anymore.
Ankylosaur has a friendly rivalry going with Armadillo over who has the better armor (see Armadillo’s character sheet, page 19, for details).
Almost before he knew it, Paul found himself in some sort of warehouse, hiding behind a bunch of big crates. Having nothing better to do (besides pray to God no one found him), Paul pulled out
a pen and substituted his address for the one on the shipping labels. Then, slowly but surely, the sounds of battle faded away, and Paul snuck out and got the hell away from there.
To his astonishment, a few days later a big delivery van pulled up to his apartment and dropped off the crates! He crowbarred them open, hoping to find something he could sell, and saw a glistening suit of powered armor, fresh from the factory and styled to look like some kind of dino- saur or something. He couldn’t believe his luck!
It took him about half a day to put the battle- suit together and figure out how it worked — and just in time. All of a sudden a squad of UNTIL agents showed up on his doorstep, having traced the delivery after the prototype Ankylosaur armor didn’t show up at its intended destination. A few grenades and an all-too-short fistfight later, and Paul had completely trashed the squad.
Ankylosaur worked as a freelance supercrimi- nall, sometimes pulling his own jobs, sometimes working for other villains, until 2004. Then his luck ran out and UNTIL caught him. Without
his armor he wasn’t considered much of a threat and was confined in an ordinary prison. But the warden underestimated him; less than a year later he engineered an escape that freed two dozen other prisoners as well. With some help from his underworld contacts, Bressler returned to Millen- nium City. Using money he’d carefully saved in the event of just such an emergency, he hired Wayland Talos to make him a new suit of Ankylosaur armor. The Talos-designed suit looks virtually the same
as the old UNTIL suit, but takes advantage of the latest technological advances to be better in almost every way. Talos also added a few features, such as retractable claws in the hands. Now Ankylosaur’s more powerful than ever.
Personality/Motivation: Paul Bressler’s nothing more than a thug and a bully with a lot of power to back up his aggressive impulses. He likes to
be big and tough, and to have a fat roll of bills
in his pocket for nights on the town, and the Ankylosaur armor gives him those things. He’s not an educated man or a deep thinker (it took him months just to learn how to pronounce the armor’s name properly), and is impressed by those who are, making it easy for master villain types to recruit him.
Years of “oppression” by the cops, courts, and other authority figures have given Ankylosaur a bitter hatred of “the man.” Anytime he gets the chance to beat the snot out of policemen, UNTIL agents, or anyone else like that, he’ll take it (much to the annoyance of his employers). If he’s in a tough spot and needs to grab a hostage, he’ll go for someone who looks “official” every time.
