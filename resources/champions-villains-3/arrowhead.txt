ARROWHEAD FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Arrowhead if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Arrowhead
is a supervillain whose powers include phenomenal agility, swiftness, and accuracy. His main weapon is a super-tech bow and arrows, but he can use just about any small object as a lethal missile.
K/R: His real name is Jared Williams. He was imprisoned in Stronghold from 2007 to 2009, but escaped during the 2009 breakout.
-2: Arrowhead is supremely confident in his abilities, loves to show off what he can do, and often has trouble resisting a challenge.
-6: Arrowhead is a mutant.
ARROWHEAD
Background/History: Jared Williams was the kid who had it all: the good looks; the good grades; the starring position on every sports team. It was the sports that really interested him; he had a natural athleticism that made other players look clumsy and slow.
Williams got into college on a full academic scholarship. It was looking like he’d make it to
the pros long before he graduated, but a jealous teammate informed the authorities Williams was taking steroids. That was completely untrue, as the investigation confirmed... but the tests involved
in proving the allegations were false revealed that Williams was a mutant. That meant he couldn’t compete in collegiate or professional sports, and since the school assumed he’d deliberately hidden his mutant nature it revoked his scholarship.
Angry and bitter, Williams drifted into gambling for awhile, making enough money to get by. He finally decided that if everyone thought he was some sort of crook, he might as well become one. After all, with his abilities, he could be a really good thief! But just being a good thief wasn’t enough for him, he wanted to be noticed and recognized. That meant becoming a supervillain — a natural enough thing, since he had super- powers (sort of) — and to be a good supervillain he needed a gimmick. After doing a little research he decided a bow and trick arrows were the best way to showcase his abilities and attract attention. Soon Arrowhead was on the streets, stealing from the rich and giving to himself.
His early career came to an abrupt halt in 2004 when he landed badly after leaping out of a third-story window, sprained his ankle, and was captured by the MCPD. After he nearly escaped from two ordinary prisons he was sent to Strong- hold in 2007. He took advantage of the 2009 breakout to escape and is now back on the street, eager to make up for lost time.
Personality/Motivation: Arrowhead has a strong streak of overconfidence born of his high level of skill and the general level of success he’s enjoyed in his life. As far as he’s concerned, between his cleverness and his uncanny aim there aren’t many obstacles that can stand in his way — and no challenges he can’t overcome (which makes him
a sucker for competitions with heroes and other villains). Stronghold was just a temporary setback; now he’s really going to show the world what he’s made of!
Quote: “All that fancy armor’s not gonna do you much good against a guy who’s skilled enough to target the eyeholes in your helmet, pal.”
Powers/Tactics: Arrowhead is a mutant with powers of supreme hand-eye coordination (and, secondarily, great agility and speed). This in turn gifts him with phenomenally accurate aim. He’s found that his aim is best when he can actually touch what he’s shooting or throwing, so he devel- oped a special bow and gimmicked arrows rather
than relying on firearms. But he can use nearly any throwable object as a missile weapon.
Arrowhead is no stranger to using deadly force, but he’s not a hardened killer. He prefers to rely on his non-lethal attacks if possible, switching only to the RKAs if he must.
Campaign Use: To make Arrowhead tougher, expand the scope of his mutant powers to give him greater control over his body — joints that can flex in any direction, bones that are practically unbreakable, and so on. You could also expand his list of Skills easily. To weaken him, get rid of his Throwing Skill Levels and remove two or three arrows from his Multipower.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Arrowhead is interested in forming (or if necessary joining) a team so he can commit more profitable crimes and protect himself from superheroes. So far he’s only spoken to Stiletto and Megavolt (both of whom
he became friends with in Stronghold), who are both intrigued by the idea but haven’t been willing to commit yet. Ideally he’d like to have four or
five other villains join him, but they have to be reasonably professional and not psychopaths or hardened killers.
Appearance: Jared Williams is a white male, 5’11” tall with blue eyes, blonde hair cut short and spikey, and a muscular, athletic build. As Arrow- head he wears a navy blue and red costume: blue half-face mask that leaves his hair free, tunic, and leggings, with red gloves, boot, belt, and quiver on his back.
