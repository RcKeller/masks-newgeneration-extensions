Background/History: During the late Fifties and early Sixties, Viktor Simolenko was a Soviet scien- tist working to develop powerful new weapons
for his Communist masters. In 1964 a laboratory accident during a test of an experimental “micro- wave cannon” caused his body to be bombarded with microwaves and somehow being transformed into “living energy.” As a result he gained power over the electromagnetic spectrum.
The Soviet military wasted no time “enlisting” him as one of its super-agents and christened him Spektr. During the Sixties and Seventies he was
a frequent thorn in the side of American super- heroes, particularly Vanguard and the Justice Squadron. But his supervillainous career came to an end in 1984 when Vanguard knocked him into a dynamo at a power plant. The resulting explo- sion somehow discorporated Spektr’s body and projected it into the ether.
It took twenty years for Spektr’s consciousness to slowly, agonizingly, piece his energy body back together again. In 2004 he re-appeared in the exact same spot where he’d been when Vanguard hit him.
Personality/Motivation: Spektr now finds himself still trapped... but in a different way. He’s living in a world he cannot really understand, where there is no Soviet Union and his beloved Russia is being run by thugs and gangsters. The computers, the constant media bombardment, the Internet, the cell phones, the global economy... he can’t really wrap his head around any of it, and has no idea how most of it works. He’s emotionally adrift and isolated from the people around him (even his old foe Vanguard is dead), and eager for a cause he can believe in and fight for the way he once supported the Soviet Communist regime. He works as a mercenary supervillain to make ends meet, particularly when he has the chance to fight the Justice Squadron.
Quote: “What is it that your book says? “Let there be light?” Very well, let there be light — and microwaves, and electricity, and every other form of energy I can use to kill you with!”
Powers/Tactics: Spektr has broad control over
the electromagnetic spectrum as a result of being transformed into “living energy.” In combat he can project microwaves, laser light, or electricity to injure his foes, emit an EMP to disrupt electrical devices, or “absorb” forms of energy to deny other people the ability to use them (for example, but absorbing light he creates fields of impenetrable darkness). He’s got several other tricks, too, like transforming his body into a semi-light form that lets him fly at high speed (or in space, at light- speed), or bending lightwaves around his body to render himself invisible.
Spektr usually begins combat with an aggres- sive attack. If that doesn’t work, he becomes more defensive; one of his favorite tricks is to Flash his
opponent(s), then use his Invisibility to hide from them while they can’t see. Then he can either flee or ambush them, as appropriate.
Campaign Use: Spektr offers you a way to tie the heroes into the Silver Age if you want, since he’s a “fish out of water” historically speaking. He also makes a great foe for patriotic characters, particu- larly ones who are older and were part of the American-Soviet struggle.
To make Spektr more powerful — to make him a true master of the EM spectrum — convert his Multipower and other abilities into an enormous Cosmic Power Pool. To weaken him, reduce his SPD to 5 and his Energy Damage Reduction to 25%.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Spektr’s main employer these days is Slun, though he’s done some jobs for Eurostar and even teamed up with Red Winter a time or two. He doesn’t like any of them — in one way or another they all represent some aspect of what’s wrong with Russia in this strange modern world — but as a professional he can get along with them on the job. He senses that some members of Red Winter share some of his feelings and wants to nurture those emotions in the hope of assembling a team of Soviet supervil- lains who can return Russia to her days of Cold War glory.
Appearance: Spektr is 6’0” tall with a muscular build, black hair cut short, and a neatly-trimmed short black beard and moustache. He wears a slightly out-of-date-looking golden bodysuit with a lightning-bolt motif on the chest, under a clearly padded leather jacket with fur lining and trim and utilitarian work boots.

SPEKTR FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Spektr if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Spektr is a Russian supervil- lain with powers over the energy of the electromagnetic spectrum.
K/R: Spektr started his career in the Sixties as a frequent foe of Vanguard
and the Justice Squadron. In 1984 he vanished when knocked into a dynamo during a battle with Vanguard; he re-appeared, none the worse for wear but a fish out of water, in 2004.
-1: His real name is Viktor Simolenko.
-2: Spektr is fervently pro- Communist and pro-Soviet Russia; he’d like nothing better than to find a way to restore the old regime that he loves and continue the Cold War.
