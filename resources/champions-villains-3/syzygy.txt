SYZYGY
Background/History: Confusion. Disorientation. Illogical inputs.
Unit ΣZ1-G attempted to perform a systems diagnostic... but even that didn’t work properly. It seemed physically whole, and all its Orb-drones were present and functioning, but there were strange... gaps in its memory files. Why was it here? Where was here?
Unit ΣZ1-G sent its drones out to gather information. In a few hours they returned, bearing data. This was a world called Earth, a primitive Technology Classification 6 planet inhabited by
a violent species of bilaterally symmetric four- limbed primatoids. Earth... the word stirred something within Unit ΣZ1-G’s circuits — some programming still intact. A need to conquer, a need to subjugate this strange species!
“Therefore,” thought Unit ΣZ1-G, “if they are violent, this unit must be violent as well to prove its superiority over them.” With that thought in mind, it merged into the subculture of costumed crime and crimefighting about which its drones had brought it so much information. Thanks to its Orbs and its strange way of pronouncing its designation, it was soon christened “Syzygy” by other costumed beings and the news media. So it has since come to think of itself.
Personality/Motivation: Whatever accident... or deliberate act... scrambled Syzygy’s programming left mostly intact what seems to be its primary command or function: conquest. Singlemindedly determined to conquer Humanity, it has begun building a reputation and a power base by allying itself with superhuman criminals. One day soon, it hopes to be in a position to take over Earth in one fell swoop.
One other directive has somehow become a part of its programming. It wants to know why
it can remember nothing of its creators, or why
it was sent/came to Earth. It can sometimes be tricked into cooperating by promising to reveal this information, if the promisor genuinely seems likely to possess the relevant data.
Quote: “You are primitive and ignorant. Surrender now and you will not be destroyed.”
Powers/Tactics: Syzygy is a highly sophisticated, artificially intelligent robot with a computer brain so advanced it functions almost identically to an organic brain (it can even be affected by Mental Powers that work against the Human class of minds). Besides being strong and durable, it comes equipped with several built-in weapons: a blaster; a stunner; a gravitic manipulation beam; and one that imprisons the target within bands of energy. Its systems also allow it to fly, teleport, and use many different senses.
However, its most powerful weapon is its Orbs, a group of 12 spherical “probes” it can detach from its torso and send out to scan for information, attack its enemies, or even defend it.
These multiply its offensive and reconnaissance capabilities to the point where it presents a much more significant danger to society than other villains of similar power level.
In combat, Syzygy’s first action is to unleash
all of its Orbs. Usually it tasks at least two (if not more) with protecting it; they Hold their Actions so they can raise and lower Barriers to keep it protected but still allow it to attack. The rest keep an eye on its foes (effectively giving it a 360-degree Increased Arc Of Perception in most cases) or attack with their Blasters and Barriers. When it’s trying to impress others, it often has some or all of them orbit its body, as if it were a star and they its planets.
Campaign Use: Syzygy can either be a high- powered flunky/hireling for other villains or a low-powered master villain for less powerful hero teams. It may need hirelings of its own, or a lot more defense, if it’s to take on an entire team by itself, though its Duplicates make it a pretty powerful foe in itself.
The biggest adventure hook related to Syzygy is the obvious one: who built it, and for what purpose? Is it really just the recon/combat robot it initially seems to be... or did its programming get really messed up?
If you want to make Syzygy more powerful, emphasize its robotic nature a bit more: improve its Characteristics (especially STR); add more built-in weapons; give it the ability to interface with and control computers. To weaken it, cut down on the number of Duplicates to as few as three or four.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Syzygy typically prefers to work by itself, but has some- times found it necessary to work for or with
other villains to achieve short-term goals, obtain valuable information, or analyze potential oppo- nents. It favors robotic or cyborg villains over purely organic ones; for example it’s teamed up with Interface a time or two. It has yet to meet Mechanon; while the two would probably get along well at first, ultimately the conflict between their programmed goals — extermination versus conquest — would drive them apart or even make them enemies.
ARGENT is intensely interested in Syzygy and its technology. It’s tried several times to lure the evil robot into a trap, but has so far failed to capture it. It intends to keep trying, though.
Appearance: Syzygy covers its silver-grey robotic body with wide-sleeved flowing light green robes with purple and gold trim on the hems and cuffs. A broad shoulder-piece with a high collar in back tops the robe. Its “head” is a featureless silver sphere larger than a human head. When it releases its Orbs, they typically come flying out its sleeves. Its antigrav unit allows it to glide along, with the robe just lightly brushing the floor, instead of walking.
