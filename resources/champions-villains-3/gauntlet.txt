GAUNTLET
Background/History: Arturo Villareal grew up poor in East Los Angeles. His family sometimes didn’t even have enough money for food. His father spent most of the time in a semi-drunken stupor, lying on the couch watching TV, so the only positive role models he had were neighbor- hood gangsters and drug dealers. They have money, power, and respect — everything Arturo wanted.
But Arturo had one thing they didn’t: brains. His was a genius intellect, and he decided to
use his intelligence as his ticket to the easy life.
He studied hard and got a scholarship to UCLA
to study science, but he had no intention of becoming some sort of researcher or corporate lab-rat. He was going to be a criminal like the men he remembered from his youth... but a supercrim- inal who’d put all of them to shame.
When he felt he was ready, Arturo began designing the super-weapons that would make him a force to be feared in the underworld. At
first he experimented with powered armor, but
the results left him dissatisfied. If nothing else, powered armor didn’t seem distinctive enough; the likes of Armadillo, Ankylosaur, and Devastator were already crowding the market. He decided
to show just how smart he was by packing most
of the power of an entire armored suit into one gadget: a set of gauntlets.
After months of effort and experimentation (not to mention a few robberies for funding and supplies), Arturo’s “Power Gauntlets” worked. After creating a suit of light powered armor, jetboots, and a helmet to go with them, he chris- tened himself Gauntlet and set out to take the underworld by storm.
Personality/Motivation: Gauntlet has a big chip on his shoulder. He resents having had to grow up poor and powerless, and he’s determined never
to be in either state ever again. He wants power, money, and respect, whether he gets them for his inventive genius or as a result of his crimes. He’s temperamental, macho, quick to take offense, and unlikely to back down from challenges. Despite the fact that he thinks of himself as an intellectual and a scientist, he really enjoys the visceral thrill of combat.
Quote: “Only a fool would think he could stand before the might of my Power Gauntlets!”
Powers/Tactics: Gauntlet is a technological and scientific genius who’s created several weapons and other devices that he uses to commit super- crimes. First and foremost among these are his Power Gauntlets, which can project many types of energy beams and produce other effects. He can blast his enemies with pulson beams (in various configurations) or lasers, stop them dead in their tracks with paralysis rays and compressed-air blasts, blind them with flare blasts and bursts, weaken them with his enervations ray, or beat them to a pulp with vastly augmented strength.

By pointing the Gauntlets toward his feet and channeling their power into a steady burst, he can make himself fly much faster.
Gauntlet usually opens combat with the biggest, flashiest attack that seems appropriate, such as a pulson blast with Explosion or a laser bolt right through some hapless foe’s heart. (He’s not a casual killer, but he has no qualms about killing if he sees a reason for it... like cowing other
enemies.) After that he tends to fight intelligently, using the best attack against a given foe (his Vari- able Special Effects and Variable Advantage attacks are often particularly helpful for this). If necessary, he can even switch to a “full defense” mode that surrounds him with both a force-field and force bubble, then use the gauntlets’ sheer power to beat his foes into unconsciousness with his HA.
Campaign Use: Gauntlet can serve in a number of roles. For less powerful groups of heroes he makes a decent semi-master villain — the adversary who hires other villains to help implement his schemes and ends up leading the charge against the PCs. In other contexts he makes a fine hireling for a true master villain, though his prickly macho attitude sometimes makes him difficult to deal with. He’d get along better with another villain as a partner or teammate than as a hireling.
To make Gauntlet tougher, make his light powered armor into more of a true suit of powered armor: increase the amount of Armor it provides, give him more Enhanced Senses and some Life Support, and so on. To weaken him, reduce the Power Gauntlets Multipower to a 90-point reserve, and all slots accordingly.
Gauntlet will Hunt heroes who offend him, humiliate him, have something he wants, or fit into his Rivalry. He usually tries to show his adver- sary that he’s superior by challenging him to duels, planning a series of crimes that only the adver- sary has a hope of stopping, and so forth. Simple physical confrontations aren’t his style... at least not until he’s exhausted some other options.
Appearance: Gauntlet is a Hispanic male, 5’9” tall with a slender, slightly muscular build. His name- sake high-tech gauntlets are silver-colored and prominent. The rest of his costume is a suit of light body armor, mostly gold with some red highlights.
