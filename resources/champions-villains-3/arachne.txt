ARACHNE
Background/History: Arachne’s origin is... uncertain. On many occasions when she’s fought costumed heroes, she’s revealed snippets of information about her past, but the story seems to change every time. Depending on which version (if any) one chooses to believe, she is:
na scientist who made herself much stronger and faster than normal with a serum derived from spider venom, then built her own equipment
nthe victim of a VIPER (or ARGENT) experi- ment using that same serum
na naturally-gifted athlete using equipment built for her by Wayland Talos
na mutant with some gadgeteering skills
Whatever the truth is, she doesn’t seem eager to reveal it for some reason. Maybe she’s just naturally secretive... or it may be that revealing her origin would endanger her life or loved ones.
Personality/Motivation: Arachne usually comes across as lighthearted, playful, and even flirta- tious (when she’s in the presence of a handsome hero or two). She makes jokes and lets slip a bit of innuendo or two while fighting (with non-lethal intent) or avoiding capture. She loves taking risks and accepting challenges and dares... but only from someone honorable enough to take as good as he gives.
Quote: “I was wondering when you’d show up. A girl gets lonely out here at night.”
Powers/Tactics: Arachne seems to be either a highly-trained athlete or a mutant whose stan- dard human attributes are much better than normal. She’s highly acrobatic and athletic, has been trained in kung fu, and is an expert at breaking and entering. If trouble arises she uses her Arachne Gloves (which can project a sticky “webbing” substance for a variety of purposes) or her Web-Darts (shuriken-like throwing blades with a spider-web motif on them). She can also fall back on her social skills and general charm if necessary.

Campaign Use: Since Arachne’s origin isn’t defined, you can easily work her into your campaign or even give her a direct (and as yet unknown!) connection to a PC. For example, if you have a PC with similar powers perhaps she’s his long-lost sister....
To make Arachne tougher, either give her some more weapons and gadgets (like cling-boots so she can walk on walls, or a dart projector that fires missiles tipped with various drugs), or give her some actual superhuman powers (like Clinging
or a “venom touch”) to complement her existing arsenal.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: If you want to give Arachne some allies, she’d make a good member of GRAB, either permanently or on an auxiliary basis. Her attitude meshes with theirs perfectly.
Appearance: Arachne is a white female, 5’9”, with an athletic build and shoulder-length dark hair. Her costume is purple-grey and dark blue; the top part is purple-grey with full-length sleeves, but ends at the waist like a one-piece bathing suit. Her legs are bare, and her flared gloves, calf-length boots, and belt are dark blue. She wears a large dark blue domino-style mask with a spider-web motif in silver on it, and a dark blue cape also with a silver spider web motif. Attached to her belt
are are several dark blue pouches containing her gadgets and weapons, and there are small box-like structures on the backs of her gloves.
