Background/History: Glacier’s origins are obscure. He first appeared during the Battle
of Detroit as one of the monstrous beings and villains unleashed on the city by Dr. Destroyer. His nature and powers tend to suggest that he’s
a magical spirit or entity of some sort (perhaps, as some mystics have speculated, a god of the north somehow reduced in power and trapped in a mindless physical form). However, it would be highly unlikely that Dr. Destroyer would become involved with such an entity, much less capture or control it somehow. And yet, breeding or creating a creature of this sort seems beyond even the science of Destroyer or Teleios.
Glacier somehow escaped the carnage of
the Battle of Detroit and fled north after being defeated by superheroes. Periodically he appeared again to attack civilization, or as a puppet being controlled by some supervillain. In 2002 the Champions, with the assistance of several other Millennium City heroes, fought him to a stand- still and finally knocked him out when some as-yet unknown person let him loose in the City of the Future. Judged to be non-intelligent and thus lacking in civil rights altogether, he was sent without trial to Stronghold to be incarcerated
in hot sleep. When Menton broke out in 2009, Glacier was one of the many villains who also escaped. He’s believed to have fled into the Arctic and hasn’t been seen since.
Personality/Motivation: None to speak of. Glacier is an unreasoning, rampaging brute who knows only that he wants to crush, destroy, rend, and kill. He’s particularly prone to destroying sources of heat, including electrical lines and generators, furnaces, and living beings.
Quote: “Graaar!” (a sound less like a roar, and more like the crackling of ice on a river, or the sound made when part of an iceberg calves off)
Powers/Tactics: Glacier has no tactics to speak of. He picks a target (usually the biggest or flashiest superhuman in the vicinity), fixates on it, and smashes it until it stops moving. If attacked by many people at once he uses one of his area- affecting attacks. If a hero (or any feature of the local environment) puts out a lot of heat, he attacks that target first; in part he seems to exist to destroy sources of warmth.
At the GM’s option, Glacier’s powers become stronger (by up to 25%) when the temperature
is extremely cold (well below freezing). When this happens, he also becomes larger. Conversely, he may get smaller and a little weaker when it’s extremely hot, or in very hot environments.
Campaign Use: Glacier is intended to be a tough enough foe to take on your entire superhero team. If he’s not, beef up his STR and defenses until he is, and/or give him some more attacks involving the control of ice and snow. Don’t make them
too sophisticated, though — he’s supposed to be
a sort of ravening beast, a force of nature, not a supervillain who’s explored all the permutations of his special effect. On the other hand, if Glacier’s already too tough, just chip away at him until he’s on the right level for your PCs.
Appearance: Glacier looks like a twelve foot tall humanoid chunk of ice. His mouth and eyes are cracks or holes in the ice; his fingers thick, sharp, squarish icicles; he has no feet, just legs that run straight to the ground. Wherever he goes things quickly frost up and ice over.

GLACIER FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Glacier if they succeed with an appro- priate Skill Roll:
N/R: Glacier is a monstrous, destructive being who has powers of ice and cold.
K/R: Some authorities believe that Glacier may be a mystic being, perhaps the embodiment of the evil powers of cold and ice, but that raises the question of why Dr. Destroyer used him as a minion during the Battle of Detroit.
-2: Glacier particularly hates sources of heat, such as electrical lines, and often attacks them during his rampages.
-4: Glacier feels great pain when hit with Fire/Heat attacks, and may become enraged.
