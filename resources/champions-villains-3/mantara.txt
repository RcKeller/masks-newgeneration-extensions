Background/History: Steffanie Landers was once a highly-ranked competitive swimmer and diver looking forward to a promising career in either marine biology or marine engineering. A driven woman, she pushed herself harder and harder to qualify for the Olympics... and failed. Refusing
to accept that she just wasn’t quite good enough, she became bitter and angry, convinced she’d been cheated. She began taking it out on the judges and winning athletes by playing malicious pranks on them, pranks that soon escalated into vandalism and other crimes. Striking back made her feel good.
Then she miscalculated and killed one of them.
It wasn’t supposed to happen that way. The garage door was supposed to slam down on the woman’s car hood, not the roof of the car right over the front seat. All Steffanie wanted to do was terrify the woman and ruin her car, not kill her... but she had to admit she felt a sort of fiendish glee that the woman had gotten what she’d deserved. As she heard police sirens approaching, Steffanie decided that if this was the hand fate had dealt her, she’d play it with relish.
She fled into hiding and began working. If she were going to be a criminal, she wouldn’t become just any criminal — she wanted to stand out from the crowd, to make a name for herself, be flam- boyant. She used her skills with underwater work and gadgetry to design and build her first Mantara armored suit and began committing crimes on and around major bodies of water. She discovered she got a real kick out of it, and that she was good at it. With several years in the supervillain busi- ness now under her belt, she’s never looked back and has no plans to quit. If anything, she’s looking for more impressive crimes to commit — it’s time to move up to the “big leagues.”
Personality/Motivation: Mantara was once a decent sort of woman, but losing out on her chance for fame and glory at the Olympics has made her self-centered and bitter. Now she only cares about herself and satisfying her own needs, whether that’s for money, revenge, or something else.
Mantara still has a strong competitive streak, especially when it comes to swimming and other aquatic sports. If she runs into someone who seems to be her match in the water, she’ll become determined to prove that she’s faster, more agile, or just plain better.
Quote: “You can’t beat me — not anywhere, but especially not in the water.”
Powers/Tactics: Mantara is most at home in the water. Heroes will rarely encounter her outside it, much less far from it — and in that case, she’ll almost certainly flee for the nearest large body of water. She feels (and often rightly so) that her experience and abilities in the water give her an edge in combat, an edge she’d otherwise lack due to the fact that she doesn’t have superpowers or

extensive weaponry. In combat she relies on Move Bys for HTH Combat and her Gauntlet Water Cannons when she fights at Range. She has rela- tively little grasp of tactics, and if possible hires a group of SCUBA-equipped thugs to help fight her battles for her.
Campaign Use: Mantara is an example of a fairly low-level speedster. Her Swimming 60m is pretty fast, but only works in a limited environment, and she’s only DEX 18, SPD 5. She shows how you can build a speedster — a movement-oriented char- acter — without rising to the level of hypervelocity and speed tricks.
To make Mantara tougher, increase her SPD and DEX until she’s more of a true speedster, or make her Mantara suit more like true powered armor — have it boost her STR and other Char- acteristics, build more weapons into it, and so on. You could also give her more weaponry, some Martial Arts, or other ways to attack. To weaken her, reduce her meters of Swimming.
Appearance: Out of her Mantara costume, Stef- fanie Landers is a beautiful woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes; she stands 5’11” tall and has a well-developed but athletic figure. Her Mantara armor adds two inches of height and completely conceals her features and her beauty. It’s a glossy black with electronic blue highlights at the joints; electronic blue lines also mark out the gloves and boots. The helmet is much more form-fitting than that of a diving suit, and has one large eyepiece across the eyes. On her back there’s a pack-like structure containing her underwater impeller and most of her oxygen supply.
