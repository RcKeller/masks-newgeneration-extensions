Background/History: It’s not easy growing up... when you don’t grow up. Robert Olivares was born with dwarfism, attaining a final adult height of only 4’2”. As a little person he was made fun
of and had trouble finding work. But despite his condition he was deft and agile, and in time his general bitterness about society and desire for the finer things in life drove him to crime. It turned out he was quite good at it, and he became highly sought after in the underworld for his ability to fit into small spaces and containers.
But he wasn’t satisfied. He felt others still looked down on him because of his size. He couldn’t even aspire to the top position in his profession — cat burglar — because of all the climbing involved, which he had difficulty with. One day he was hit by an epiphany. He didn’t have to be able to climb up to places he wanted to rob. With the right technology he could leap there.
Inspired by this idea, he began training hard, practicing acrobatic maneuvers. When not exer- cising he was working on a special set of “spring- boots” that could give him the power to leap tremendous distances. When the boots were done, he started training again, combining his acrobatic prowess with his enhanced leaping power. When he felt the time had come, he christened himself El Salto (“the Leapfrog”) and set out to prove that he was as good as any full-sized thief.
Personality/Motivation: El Salto has developed
a (humorously) inflated sense of self-worth to compensate for his physical shortcomings. In his mind, he’s the smartest, cleverest, and especially the handsomest guy around, and anyone who doesn’t realize it is a fool. He particularly thinks that women should realize what a “catch” he is, and flirts outrageously at every opportunity (even in mid-combat).
El Salto is justifiably proud of his leaping abili- ties, and if he encounters other leapers usually challenges them to a “duel” or contest. He’s even prouder of his large, luxuriant moustache, and anyone who insults it risks his wrath (increase his Enraged “go” roll to 14- when his moustache is involved).
Quote: “Do not theenk that because I am short of stature that I am small in all ways, señorita. Come, let us stop this fooleesh fighting and find better uses for our time toogaither....”
Powers/Tactics: El Salto isn’t a powerful combatant, and he knows it. He prefers to avoid fights altogether, but if he can’t he relies on his mobility and agility in combat. He keeps most
(if not all) of his Combat Skill Levels in DCV and relies on Move Bys/Throughs and his Pinball Attack to hurt his foes while staying on the move.

Campaign Use: El Salto is mostly a humorous character, intended as comedy relief and as an NPC who’ll simultaneously make the heroes groan and chuckle. Play him to the outrageous hilt, having him flirt non-stop with female PCs, mock male PCs, and enjoy the hell out of himself as he commits crimes. Use an exaggerated Mexican accent and over-the-top cheesy dialogue.
If for some strange reason you want to make
El Salto tougher, give him even more meters of Leaping, perhaps a few more “leaping tricks,” or
a Ranged weapon of some sort. You could also build a “Leaping Martial Arts” package for him. To weaken him, remove his Skill Levels and Combat Skill Levels with HTH Combat.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: El Salto has worked with many non-violent villains. He likes teaming up with GRAB a lot, but rarely gets the chance to anymore because the women in the group are rarely willing to put up with his constant come-ons and double entendres. Esper despises him for the same reason.
Foxbat regards El Salto as one of his arch- nemeses, though the two have never met. Word of this has gotten back to El Salto through the grapevine; he’s convinced Foxbat is jealous of his luxuriant moustache.
Appearance: El Salto is a Mexican man who stands a mere 4’2” tall, but from his air of supe- riority you’d think he was a giant. His costume is a green full bodystocking that covers him from head to toe (though it leaves his face exposed
so everyone can see his moustache), plus yellow boots, belt, gloves, and domino mask. He has a large, luxuriant moustache of which he’s inordi- nately proud, and speaks English with an outra- geous Mexican accent.
