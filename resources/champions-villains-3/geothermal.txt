Background/History: Jason Dixon was a geolo- gist with a driving ambition: to become the first scientist to take direct samples of Earth’s mantle. Previous attempts to drill down to the mantle had failed, so Dixon had something else in mind: he would build a special suit that would (a) render him intangible so he could get down there, and (b) protect him when he re-solidified to take samples. But suits like that were expensive, and he wasn’t having any luck raising funds until he spoke with GeoMax, a company involved in oil drilling and similar pursuit. Unfortunately, what Dixon didn’t know was that GeoMax was mostly a front for ARGENT... and ARGENT was willing to sponsor him simply to use him as a guinea pig.
It took over a year, but finally Dixon finished building his suit in 1985. With GeoMax’s blessing, he “took off ” from their facility near Detroit and began “walking” down toward the mantle. The suit worked perfectly! Eventually he reached his destination, turned solid again, and began taking samples.
That’s when the disaster occurred. His GeoMax handlers couldn’t understand his radio transmis- sions; they were too garbled by static and his own terrified screams. But eventually the screams stopped. Assuming he’d been roasted or crushed to death, ARGENT declared the project a failure.
Two days later, a new superhuman announced his existence by causing a volcano to grow up right in the middle of the GeoMax building. Rising from it like a phoenix was a humanoid shape that looked like it was made of igneous rock and fueled by internal lava. “HUMANS!” he shouted in a voice that could be heard for miles. “Your steward- ship of this planet has been found wanting. The Earth will be cleansed of your infestation!” Then he began destroying every human structure he could see and killing anyone who didn’t get away from him fast enough.
Local Detroit superheroes responded, but were unable to withstand the being’s power. But they held the line long enough for the Sentinels to get there. The Sentinels fought Geothermal, as the press christened him, to a standstill; when he was unable to defeat them he fled back into the Earth, to depths where none of the heroes could follow.
Three times after that, in 1987, 1990, and 1992, Geothermal attacked major cities (London, Miami, and New York , respectively), declaring once more his intention to wipe Humanity off the face of the Earth. Each time he was narrowly defeated by a superhero team... and that last time, the Justice Squadron and Sentinels working together finally knocked him out before he could escape. Stronghold personnel were called in to insure he could be held pending trial. He was found guilty of dozens of counts of murder and other violent crimes. His sentence: hot sleep for life.
From 1993 until 2009, Geothermal was a resident of Level Omega at Stronghold. Some questioned the wisdom of placing him so deep within the Earth, and perhaps they were right. When Menton broke free in 2009, the resulting chaos freed Geothermal as well... and he quickly burrowed away into the earth. He hasn’t been seen since, but the authorities fear it’s only a matter
of time before he begins his assault on humanity once more.
Personality/Motivation: Jason Dixon’s former personality — fun-loving but intense, dedicated to his work, gregarious — has been totally lost. Geothermal doesn’t even know he used to be someone called “Jason Dixon.” All that’s left is
an abiding desire to rule the world, largely by eliminating around 90% of Humanity to save Earth from their “infestation.” He’s been adopted as a cause by certain radical environmentalists, who considered him a “political prisoner” until he broke free, but he doesn’t care for them any more than he does for other humans.
Quote: “The purity of Earth shall prevail over the corruption of Humanity!”
Powers/Tactics: Geothermal possesses tremen- dous superhuman power involving lava and rock. He can fire blasts of lava, cause mini-eruptions
of lava to spurt up from the ground, and even make finger-like spars of rock lance out of the ground to hit or impale anyone within 16m.
He can also tunnel through the ground at high speed and “run” quickly by riding a “wave” of earth and stone. Add to that the fact that he’s able to withstand damage that would knock most supervillains out cold and you’ve got one major source of destruction and chaos.

GEOTHERMAL FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Geothermal if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Geothermal
is an extremely powerful supervillain with power over rock and lava. He’s also incredibly difficult to hurt. His goal is to “cleanse the Earth” of most of humanity, leaving himself
to rule over the remnants and restore the Earth to its “rightful condition.”
K/R: From 1993 until 2009, Geothermal was in hot sleep
in Stronghold; he escaped when Menton broke out.
-2: Insulting, mocking, or taunting Geothermal often sends him into a rage.
-8: Geothermal suffers great pain when attacked with Magnetic or Gravity energy.
-10: His “Secret Identity” is Jason Dixon, a former geologist.

Geothermal likes to open battle with a long-winded Presence Attack that proclaims his purpose and invites his opponents to surrender. If that doesn’t work, he attacks the most powerful- looking foe (or group of foes) with one of his Lava Blasts, or he commits some major act of mayhem and destruction (like attacking the support columns of a nearby skyscraper). If someone interrupts him or makes fun of him, he responds by smashing that foe with the biggest attack he can muster.
Campaign Use: Geothermal represents a major risk to Stronghold. If he ever gets out of hot sleep, the destruction he can wreak against an under- ground installation is inestimable. Just the fact that he could Tunnel right out of the mesa means he’d leave an escape route for dozens of other villains.
A big mystery surrounds Geothermal: how exactly did he get his powers? Did his suit fail and his body somehow become infused with lava? Are there beings living in Earth’s mantle who attacked and/or somehow transformed him? Did he offend some mystic spirit of the Earth that dwells within the mantle, and now serves it as its pawn in the surface world?
To make Geothermal tougher, just keep increasing his defenses and STUN (and if neces- sary, the DCs in his attacks) until he’s a major threat to your entire group of PCs — that’s the level of power he should have. If necessary, assume he has more powers involving large-scale manipu- lation of earth and lava to do things like destroy buildings, threaten entire stadiums’ worth of people, and so on (in this case, think of his char- acter sheet as representing his tactical-level attacks but not his strategic-level powers, so to speak).
To weaken him, reduce his Damage Reduction to 50%, and perhaps his SPD to 6.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Geothermal hates all human life, so he doesn’t interact with other superhumans at all (not even robots or aliens). ARGENT has correctly deduced that he used to be Jason Dixon and wants to capture him for study and exploitation.
Some authorities (and supervillain fans) have speculated about a team-up between Mechanon and Geothermal, since their goals are similar. It will almost certainly never happen; Geothermal’s still an organic in Mechanon’s eyes, and thus just another being to destroy.
Appearance: Geothermal is a human male whose skin is the color (and to some extent, consistency) of burnt brown cinders. His eyes have the color and glow of lava, and that same glow can be seen in his mouth when he opens it. He has no hair anywhere on his body. During his villainous career his costume was a pair of trunks and a cloak that matched the color of his eyes; now in “hot sleep” in Stronghold all he wears is a plain white cotton hospital gown.
