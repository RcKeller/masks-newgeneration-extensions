Background/History: With Emil Nelson, it always boiled down to “What’s in it for me?” As a young kid he got started running numbers for the local gangs, and gradually worked his way up to more serious crimes. Soon he attracted some serious attention from the police. To get away from them, he joined the Army.
It turned out to be the best decision he ever made. Not only did he learn about weapons and fighting, he found out that there was a lot of corruption he could take advantage of. He supple- mented his salary by dealing drugs, arranging
for shipments of guns to “accidentally and not on purpose fall off the backs of trucks,” and selling stolen Army gear on the black market.
When his hitch was up, he put his experiences and skills to work by becoming first a supplier
of mercenaries and mercenary companies, and later a merc himself. As much fun as running
his own little criminal empire was, being a merc was better; he found he really came alive on the battlefield.
One day, Nelson’s contacts back in the Army gave him a hot tip about an experimental laser weapon DARPA was about to test. Sensing the potential for profit, he snuck onto the base, bluffed his way into the control center, and stole the weapon, along with a jetpack and body armor that went with it. At first he planned to sell the whole package, but the more he examined it, the more he thought about keeping it. With a weapon like this, he could really make a name for himself. There was even enough firepower here for him to move beyond the African battlefields and start taking on superheroes! He soon decided to keep the equip- ment for himself.
Choosing the name Lazer, Nelson hit the Superhuman World with a vengeance, pulling
off three major jobs and killing the superhero Ballistik all in the year 1993. Since then, his repu- tation and skills have only improved.
Personality/Motivation: Lazer is the ultimate mercenary supervillain: there’s almost nothing he won’t do for money, and he’ll withstand just about any form of interrogation, up to and including hard torture, before he reveals anything about his employer. He’s never betrayed an employer, and rarely failed to complete his assigned missions, which means he doesn’t have to look for work much — it comes looking for him.
Lazer tends to have a low opinion of many superheroes. He regards them as pajama-wearing adolescents who don’t really understand how to do their jobs. This has gotten him in trouble a time
or two when a superhero proved smarter than he expected. He’s developed a healthy measure of respect for heroes like Nighthawk, who have as much tactical sense as he does.
Quote: “Did that hurt? Don’t worry — the next one’s gonna take aaallll the pain away... permanently.”
Powers/Tactics: Lazer is a tough, highly-trained mercenary equipped with a sophisticated experi- mental laser rifle (he also carries a laser sidearm that Wayland Talos built for him). He can vary the width and intensity of the beam to achieve many different effects; his rifle is a lot more versatile than many heroes give it credit for.
In battle, Lazer is intelligent, clever, and tacti- cally aware. He usually opens up with his Primary Laser, but he’ll quickly switch to other configu- rations if that’s not the right setting. He makes full use of his every asset, including his ability to fly and see in the dark. He has a natural gift for combat, and should be played accordingly.
Campaign Use: Lazer works perfectly as a master villain’s henchman, or a member of a team of villains assembled to pull off a particular crime.
If you need to make Lazer more powerful, you have lots of options. First, you can give him more weapons — some grenades, a laser-sword, lasers built into his armor, and so on. Second, you can beef up his Martial Arts, giving him more maneu- vers and more Extra DCs. Third, you can increase his Skill selection; he could have learned all sorts of things during his career as a mercenary. Or, of course, you can try some combination of these alternatives. On the other hand, if he’s too tough already, reduce his Laser Rifle’s Charges from 64 to 32 (or 16), reduce the Rifle’s Active Point reserve to 50 points, and/or reduce his SPD to 4.

Lazer is a dangerous Hunter. He stalks his target like a predator pursuing prey, striking from ambush when least expected and not pulling any punches. A High-Intensity Laser blast when the target is in the middle of a family event or social function works best, he’s found. But he’s smart enough to know there’s not much money in vendetta, so he tries to avoid letting his personal likes and dislikes interfere with his work.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: As a merce- nary supervillain, Lazer’s worked with practically everyone in the business — VIPER, ARGENT,
the Crimelords, Merc-Force 1, the Ultimates,
and many, many more. His professionalism has kept him on good terms with most of them. One notable exception is the Ultimates, who blame him for screwing up a job a few years ago (he insists it was their fault, not his).
Other mercenary supervillains — Hazard, Scimitar, Mechassassin, and the Steel Commando, for example — are Lazer’s rivals (particularly the latter two, who have similar equipment and modus operandi). He’ll work with them if an employer insists, but they’re more likely to be found trying to interfere with (or kill) one another. On the other hand, Lazer and Double Dealer are good friends, often meeting up for a drink when they have the chance.
Lazer’s reputation has become so good that the Warlord has issued him an ultimatum: join my organization, or die. So far he’s stayed one step ahead of the world’s most powerful arms dealer, and he knows he can’t rest if he wants to keep it that way.
Appearance: Lazer wears a suit of bronze-colored light body Resistant Protection (including helmet) with a jetpack on his back. His main weapon is a laser rifle in the same colors, and he also carries
a laser pistol sidearm in a holster on his right hip. He carries himself with an air of confidence, competence, and efficiency.
Out of his armor, Emil Nelson is an average- looking white male in his late thirties standing 5’11” tall and weighing about 190 pounds. He has a trim, athletic build, dark hair cut short, and dark eyes.
