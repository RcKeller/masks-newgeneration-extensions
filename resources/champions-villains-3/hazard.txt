HAZARD FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Hazard if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Hazard is a mercenary supervil- lain who’s renowned for his preternatural luck. He carries a powerful energy pistol and also knows martial arts.
K/R: Hazard can fly thanks to the jetpack he wears.
-2: Hazard’s luck protects him in all sorts of subcon- scious ways; for example it’s very difficult to sneak up on him.
-4: Hazard and Nighthawk have clashed on several occasions, but the costumed crime- fighter’s never been able to capture him.
-10: His Secret Identity is David Weinstein; he used to be a US Army soldier.


Background/History: David Weinstein, a child- hood friend of Mark (Nighthawk) Whitaker, joined the Army after graduating high school in 1986. While serving in the Gulf War, Weinstein was on a patrol in the Kuwaiti desert when he found a strange bracelet. Fascinated by the small gemstones, Weinstein tucked it into his pocket. When he returned to his unit’s base camp that night, he won so much money in a poker game that some of his friends accused him of cheating. They planned to give him a beating that night, but improbable misfortunes struck them before they could harm him — one slipped and fell in a pit, breaking his arm; another’s pistol accidentally discharged, shooting the third in the leg.
Eventually Weinstein realized the bracelet gave him preposterously good luck. He left the Army, purchased a couple of lottery tickets, and with
the winnings bought himself a nice penthouse apartment in Detroit. His luck saved him from the Battle of Detroit — he was out of town when it happened, and when he returned his building had miraculously been spared from the fires.

Weinstein soon tired of using his luck for mundane purposes. Wanting to see the world and lacking any particular scruples against killing, he became the mercenary/assassin Hazard, special- izing in “impossible” kills: the wealthy, the difficult to find, the superpowered.
Personality/Motivation: Hazard selects the jobs he takes based on how likely they are to alleviate his boredom. His luck makes his daily life so easy that only the “Great Game” of superpowered conflict holds his interest. He charges surprisingly little
— as long as the target holds sufficient interest and presents him with a challenge, Hazard takes
a contract for much less money than his competi- tors. He’s killed over thirty people by contract,
but he won’t kill casually — he makes every effort to avoid killing bystanders and even interfering lawmen and superheroes (though he will kill them if necessary to maintain his freedom).
Quote: “Feeling lucky, hero? I am.”
Powers/Tactics: Hazard’s powers all come from
a strange disruption of probability created by the “lucky charm” he wears. (The charm itself is small, worn under his costume and almost never taken away, so he receives no Focus Limitation for it. In fact, he’s never revealed its existence to another soul.) Beyond his luck powers, he’s a skilled marksman, hand-to-hand combatant, and spy, and wears a suit of light, high-tech battle armor for protection.
Hazard prefers to strike from surprise. If he cannot, he relies on his Blaster Pistol as much as he can, switching to hand-to-hand combat only when pressed or directly challenged. Although he couldn’t command a group of soldiers, he has a good head for personal tactics, and often finds a way to use cover or the environment to his advantage.
Hazard’s luck plays a part in just about any battle he participates in; you should roll his Luck dice at least once or twice during the course of
a combat. Typically his enemies’ weapons jam, something falls on, trips, or hinders his oppo- nents, or events arrange themselves to aid his escape.
Campaign Use: Hazard makes an entertaining second-tier villain, suitable for hire by any of the behind-the-scenes masterminds in your campaign. He’s particularly useful as a way for a Hunter to harass a PC indirectly. Once Hazard accepts an assignment, his Code Of Honor won’t let him give up — he keeps trying until he succeeds, he dies, or his client calls off the hit.
If you want to make Hazard more powerful, give him more weapons and some Extra DCs for his Martial Arts. You could also build some other gadgets into his powered armor (sense-enhancers, communicators, and the like). If he’s already too difficult for the PCs to cope with, reduce his Luck dice (perhaps to as little as 6d6), decrease some
of his Characteristics, and tone down his Blaster Pistol.

Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Hazard
has worked several times for ACI’s owner, Franklin Stone, and also for the unscrupulous Congressman Bradley Dixon. He and Night- hawk have come into conflict several times, with Nighthawk thwarting a couple of Hazard’s kills but never actually capturing him.
Hazard considers other super-mercenaries — villains like Lazer, Mechassassin, Scimitar, and the Steel Commando — as his rivals. So far his luck has made sure he gets plenty of work so that the rivalry’s more a matter of personal pride and brag- ging rights than anything else... at least as far as he’s concerned. They tend to view him as an inter- loper who’s literally getting by more on luck than on skill and would prefer to remove him from the marketplace altogether. Unfortunately for them, getting the drop on one of the world’s luckiest men isn’t exactly easy.
Appearance: Hazard is a white male in his late thirties, 5’11” and about 180 pounds. Out of costume he’s intentionally nondescript, with brown hair conservatively cut, brown eyes, and a natural skill for blending into crowds. His battle armor, on the other hand, is a form-fitting gold and brown suit, with a cowl covering the top half of his head, high-tech goggles protecting his eyes, and a sleek back-mounted jetpack. He carries a focused-plasma blaster, and his belt has several small pouches to carry lockpicks and other small devices.
