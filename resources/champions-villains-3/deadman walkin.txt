Background/History: Darren Williams was once one of the highest-paid assassins in the world. He had an almost-unblemished record, and had never been captured or hurt on the job... until he came to Vibora Bay on a contract to kill a City Coun- cillor and Robert Caliburn put two bullets in his chest.
He “woke up” in the morgue a few days later, amazed to discover he was alive... only to find out that he wasn’t. He was unlive, or undead if you prefer, though he had no idea why. Never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, he escaped from the facility, murdering two medical examiners on the way out. Since then he’s continued his lucrative career as a killer for hire, though he takes on a lot more superhuman and paranormal targets than he used to.
Personality/Motivation: In life, Darren Williams was greedy, callous, cruel, and sociopathic. In unlife, Deadman Walkin’ is all of those things, and more. He’s developed an active loathing for anyone living, a hatred of them for their ability to enjoy the simple pleasures he no longer can (eating, sleeping, companionship...). The only joy he gets now is in killing people — and he’s always eager to enjoy himself some more.
Quote: “In a second you’ll be dead like me... but you won’t be gettin’ back up.”
Powers/Tactics: There’s nothing complicated about Deadman Walkin’s abilities: he’s an undead assassin. His attacks are the weapons he favored in life (rifle, handgun, knife), and his undead state makes him far stronger and tougher than he ever was when he still had to breathe. Thanks to his resilience, he’s willing to take foolish risks if he has to, like jumping off tall buildings to escape pursuers. He thinks of himself as indestructible, though he’s not.
Deadman Walkin’ prefers to strike from surprise whenever he can — all he asks out of unlife is a little unfair advantage, as he likes to say. His favorite method of taking out a target is sniping, but he can also use explosives, poison, or close combat if he has to. If confronted and forced into open combat, he’ll fight at first, but cut and run as soon as things start to go wrong.
As an undead being, Deadman Walkin’ is susceptible to spells and powers of a necromantic nature. For example, a spell to control or harm zombies works on him, though he’s not strictly a zombie. The GM determines whether his Physical Complication applies to a particular ability.
Campaign Use: Deadman Walkin’ comes with one big background mystery: how did he come back to “life”? Did a mystic raise him from the dead
for some reason? Did ambient magical energies,
a Necromancy spell gone wrong, or a powerful Voodoo ritual improperly controlled spontane- ously cause his resurrection as a free-willed zombie? Do Caliburn’s angel-touched bullets have unintended side effects? Was Williams simply too strong-willed to die? The answers to those ques- tions may just lead to more questions, including: will whatever brought him back to unlife make him more powerful over time?
If you want to make Deadman Walkin’ more powerful, you can increase his Characteristics (turning him into a sort of brick), or you can give him mystic powers relating to his undead state. Maybe he has a death touch, can project bolts of necromantic energy, or the like. To weaken him, reduce his Characteristics a little and his Damage Reduction to 25%.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Deadman Walkin’ works more for governments and busi- nesses than superhuman employers, but he’s open to contracts from anyone who can pay. Past employers from the Superhuman World have included Slun, Joseph Otanga, and ARGENT, all of whom he maintains irregular contact with.
Appearance: If it weren’t for the fact that he long ago gave up the ghost, Deadman Walkin’ would look like a fit, muscular man. As it is, his skin has the pallor of death, with bluish lips and sunken eyes. Here and there he’s stitched up gashes and wounds, since he no longer heals like a living being does. He wears tattered military fatigues and gear... but his weapons (a rifle, a sidearm, and a large knife) are in perfect condition, clean and well-polished, creating an eerie contrast.
