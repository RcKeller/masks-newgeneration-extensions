Background/History: The Stalker was once Billy Hearn, born in Wyoming in 1852. Hearn was a criminal, a cheater at cards, an occasional cattle rustler, and sometimes a member of a small gang of bank robbers. In 1878 he fell afoul of a vampire called Carraway. The bloodsucker killed Hearn and several of his friends, transforming them into a pack of vampire henchmen to attack his enemy, the sixth Black Mask. Narrowly avoiding being staked like his sire during their final confrontation in a burning church near Soda Lake, Hearn struck off on his own, traveling south and east while leaving a trail of death and horror in his wake. He soon began thinking of himself under another name: Stalker.
After nearly 80 years of careful killing, during which he encountered but escaped from several of the great Pulp heroes, Stalker’s luck ran out. In 1957 in rural Texas he had a run-in with El Espe- ctro. The masked Mexican wrestler, an expert at fighting vampires and other monsters, staked him through the heart, leaving him a paralyzed skel- eton. El Espectro intended to burn the bones and kill Stalker for good, but at that point the floor of the printing plant they were fighting in collapsed, and the skeleton was lost in the rubble.

STALKER FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Stalker if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Stalker is a powerful vampire who prowls the streets of Vibora
Bay (and some- times other cities)
in search of human prey. He has most of the classic vampire strengths and weak- nesses... but not all.
K/R: Prior to arriving in Vibora Bay in 2005, Stalker cut
a swath of terror across the South.
-2: Stalker lacks the traditional vampire’s fear of running water and of garlic.
-10: Stalker was once Billy Hearn, an outlaw in the Wild West. He fought many of the great Victorian- and Pulp- era heroes, but was finally staked by El Espectro in 1957... only to be re-awak- ened by a construc- tion crew building a mall in 2001.

Almost half a century later, in 2001, a Texas construction company working overtime to
build a new shopping mall discovered a previ- ously unknown cavern beneath the site. A worker found an intact skeleton inside it, with a wooden stake running through the ribcage. Not realizing what he’d discovered he removed the stake. A few minutes later Stalker was alive again. He killed
the worker and escaped into the night, resuming his reign of terror across the South until he made his way to Vibora Bay in late 2005. There he encountered the descendant of his old nemesis, the tenth Black Mask, and began a fateful game of cat-and-mouse on the streets at night, culminating in his physically defeating and nearly killing her. He remains at large in Vibora Bay, hunting both his revived enemy, her sidekick Nocturne, and
her friends and loved ones... as well as anyone
else who takes his fancy. Adapting to the modern world has taken him a little time, but now that he’s used to it he thinks it’s a fine hunting ground.
Personality/Motivation: Stalker is first and fore- most a predator. All of humanity is his prey, and he greatly enjoys the stimulation of a challenging hunt. However, he’s found that superhumans are a little too challenging, so he carefully avoids them. He’s content to stick with the likes of Black Mask, who’s just a highly-trained and well-equipped human.
Quote: “The most beautiful music is when they scream. Will you sing me a song, too, little one?”
Powers/Tactics: Stalker is a classic vampire, with a vampire’s strengths and weaknesses. He can transform himself into wolf, bat, or mist form;
he’s physically powerful and resilient; he can drain someone’s blood (and if necessary turn his victim into a vampire); he has no reflection; he can’t abide the touch of holy objects or direct sunlight. On the other hand he lacks some of the classic vampiric weaknesses — he can cross running water freely and doesn’t mind garlic at all. This may throw your heroes for a loop if they try those tricks on him. He may even fake being affected by, say, garlic to lure a victim in closer.
Stalker isn’t much of a stand-up-and-fight combatant. He’s a hunter, and prefers to be in a situation where he’s stalking his prey and the prey has to react to him. He’ll patiently follow a target, waiting for just the right moment of solitude and unawareness to strike. If the situation changes to one where he’s having to react to what his target does, he usually flees to await another chance to hunt.
Campaign Use: Stalker works well in any campaign where you have at least one hero who’s “low-powered” enough for a classic vampire to make an intriguing foe. He’s less well-suited as a traditional superhero adversary, but would work well as a lieutenant or henchman for a villain like Takofanes, Dark Seraph, or the Demonologist. (He might even be a suitable candidate for member- ship in the Devil’s Advocates.)

To make Stalker tougher, make him a “super- heroic” vampire. Increase his STR to 50, raise his PD and ED to 25 each (fully Resistant), and so on. To weaken him, give him all the classic vampiric weaknesses.
Appearance: Stalker is a thin man of indetermi- nate age, with a shock of white hair, pale skin, and sunken eyes with tiny pupils. His features are drawn and he gives off an air of almost frailty, at least until he starts moving with his catlike grace. He doesn’t have a regular costume; he prefers either finely-tailored suits or dark leather “club- bing” ensembles when he stalks his prey at night.
