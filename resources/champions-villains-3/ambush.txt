AMBUSH
Background/History: Keera Hancock grew up on the hardest, meanest streets of Los Angeles. She never knew who her father was, and her mother spent most of the day blitzed out on coke or heroin; she was raised primarily by her grand- mother. But even that kindly woman’s affection couldn’t keep her from responding to the lure of the streets. She started running with gangs young and looked like she was on a short road to a quick death.
Naturally, it didn’t take long for her to get hooked on cocaine (though she was at least smart enough to avoid heroin; she’d seen what it had done to her mother). One night another girl in her circle, jealous of the fact that most of the boys seemed to pay attention to Keera more than her, slipped Keera some pure, uncut cocaine, hoping it would cause an overdose and kill her. Overdose Keera did... but she didn’t die. Instead, somehow the reaction caused her latent mutant powers to surface. In a drug-induced haze she began tele- porting all over the place at random. Fortunately, the only person around to see it was her rival, and the terrified girl fled for her life and never told a soul.
After she was back to her normal self, Keera discovered she could control the teleporting (though she also soon found out it became harder to use her powers if she didn’t snort a line or two of coke at least once a day). Realizing this was her ticket to real money, she chose the supervillain name Ambush and set out to make it in the big leagues. So far she hasn’t succeeded, but no one’s caught her yet so she keeps trying.
Personality/Motivation: Although she’s now in her mid-twenties, Ambush isn’t really a very mature person. Life’s taught her that no one looks out for you but you, so that’s what she does — and who cares about anyone else. She’s smart enough to stay loyal to anyone who hires her, but otherwise betraying and backstabbing people to get what she wants doesn’t bother her in the slightest. She’s also petty, vain, and given to fits of jealousy.

Quote: “If you think you can catch me, you’re in
for a shock.”
Powers/Tactics: Ambush has a single fairly powerful general Teleportation ability, and a blink teleportation defensive power (both slightly dependent, as mentioned above, on her daily use of cocaine). She’s more of a sneak and a thief than a fighter, but she carries a Taser Baton with which she can hit or shock (or both!) opponents.
Ambush doesn’t want to engage in open combat — like her name suggests, she prefers to strike from surprise, grab whatever she’s after, and flee. If she has to fight, she relies on her Blink Tele- portation to compensate for her low defenses and will do her best to avoid people with area-affecting attacks and the like.
Campaign Use: Ambush is a (relatively) low- powered character suitable as-is for lower- powered games (such as some Teen Champions campaigns) or as a lesser superpowered minion for higher-powered games. To make Ambush a tougher foe for your PCs, expand her teleporta- tion powers (Champions Powers has dozens of examples) and make her a more confident, capable fighter. To weaken her, reduce her Blink Teleporta- tion to only +4 DCV.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Kinematik has spoken with Ambush about joining his pro- mutant group, and she’s considering it. She defi- nitely likes the idea of being part of a group and pulling down bigger scores, but loyalty to a single person or an abstract cause isn’t really her thing. She may end up joining for the benefits and then leave when she gets sick of Kinematik’s posturing... which will earn her a deadly enemy for life.
Appearance: Ambush is a black female, mid- twenties, 5’7”, athletically built, with a cornrow hairstyle. She doesn’t wear a costume per se — she favors t-shirts and ratty jeans, and doesn’t bother with a mask.
