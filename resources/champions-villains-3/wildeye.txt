Background/History: Wilson Dempsey was born deformed, or so his parents and doctors thought. He had far too much hair for a baby (not just on his head, but his back and arms), his fingernails were oddly long and sharp, and his teeth unusually pointed. A series of tests soon revealed that he was a mutant. His terrified parents abandoned him, leaving the social services system to raise him.
By the time he was in grade school it was already apparent that Dempsey’s differences were more than just physical, they were psychological. A bestial attitude mirrored his bestial features. His bullying and terrifying “pranks” soon led the orphanages he lived at to segregate him from the other children. By his mid-teens he already had a lengthy police record for a wide variety of minor (and not so minor) assaults, vandalism, and the like.
He tolerated “the system” until he was 16. One night he got fed up with yet another administrator trying to tell him what to do. He slashed her with his claw-like nails, nearly killing her, and fled to the streets. Soon he was doing enforcement work for various gangs, putting his creepy appearance and natural weapons to good use. During this period one of the gang leaders he worked for nick- named him Wildeye, and he adopted the name as a badge of honor.
Slowly but surely Wildeye worked his way up the underworld ladder until he was a genuine supervillain working with other costumed crimi- nals. A lot of villains didn’t much like him, but it didn’t matter as long as he was good enough to keep getting work. Then one of his rivals — he’s never learned who — sold him out to the cops, and he ended up in Stronghold. But thanks to the 2009 Menton-sparked breakout, he’s back on the streets.
Personality/Motivation: Wildeye has a vicious, bestial temper that makes him prone to lashing out at anyone who annoys, frustrates, or insults him. He views other humans more as prey than people (though he’s not a cannibal), and thus feels no qualms at all about killing them.
Quote: “I spy... with my little wildeye... someone who’s about to die.”
Powers/Tactics: Wildeye is a mutant with beast- like powers. His senses are incredibly acute, his reflexes and strength vastly superior to those of ordinary humans, and his fingernails and teeth are long and sharp enough to qualify as claws and fangs. Stronghold personnel had to trim his nails about once a week using a pair of tin snips, and about once a month sent him to the medical facility to have his teeth filed down; he loathed both procedures and has promised himself that one day he will kill everyone who ever worked at Stronghold during his stay there.
Campaign Use: To make Wildeye tougher, give him Martial Arts for his claws. You could also expand the scope of his abilities a bit, perhaps giving him some Regeneration or the ability to summon and control animals. To weaken him, reduce his STR to 15, DEX to 21, CON to 20, and SPD to 5.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Wildeye’s appearance and mannerisms, combined with his murderousness, disturb most villains enough that they don’t want to work with him — which suits him just fine, since he’s something of a loner by inclination. Sometimes Merc-Force 1 or VIPER need his sort of muscle and give him a call. The only villain he really thinks of as a friend is Fenris; they’ve worked together on several occasions.
Appearance: Wildeye’s general appearance could best be described as “creepy”; it tends to disturb
a lot of people. His hair is long and black, and usually tied back in a sort of long ponytail; his hirsute body has noticeably thick dark hair on
the lower arms, back, chest, and legs. His finger- nails are long and thick enough to serve as claws, and his teeth are a little longer and much more pointed than a normal person’s. Most disturbing of all are his eyes, which are red with yellow pupils and slightly angled; they remind many people
of the sort of monstrous eyes seen staring out of the darkness in movies and Fantasy paintings.
He wears a costume consisting of nothing more than tight-fitting purple-blue pants with mid-calf- length legs.
WILDEYE FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Wildeye if they succeed with an appro- priate Skill Roll:
N/R: Wildeye is a supervillain with animal powers — his fingernails are claw-like, his teeth are small fangs, his senses as good as those of a beast, his reflexes as swift as a cheetah’s.
K/R: His real name is Wilson Dempsey; he’s a mutant and a ruthless killer.
-2: Wildeye has very little self-control; if annoyed, frustrated, or insulted, he’s likely to lash out, often with lethal force.
