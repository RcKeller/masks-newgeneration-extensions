BROMION
Background/History: The Ordainer called Bromion didn’t always work for Urizen the Lawgiver. Bromion was once a great Lords of Arti- fice, a Son of Los and one of his father’s chief assis- tants at the forge of worlds. Bromion served as the Prime Avatar of Art’s envoy to Order, personifying the critical faculty. He often worked with Urizen when the Zoas of Art and Order cooperated to create a civilization.
Bromion came to sympathize too strongly with Urizen’s plans to regiment life throughout the Multiverse. He decided Urizen’s Order was also the highest expression of Art. This led him into conflict with other children of Los. The dispute escalated until Bromion raped Oothoon, the soul of sweet delight and Emanation of his brother Theotormon. Outraged, Theotormon captured Bromion and imprisoned him. Bromion escaped, however, by renouncing his status as a Son of
Los and cosmic entity. Instead he became one of Urizen’s Ordainers.
When Bromion fell from Briah into the worlds of Matter, he lost much of his power. But with the Millworks (see text box) as a base of operations, Bromion still wields enough power to bring other worlds and beings under Urizen’s sway. He is
one of the most devoted and dangerous Lords of Order.
Personality/Motivation: Bromion is a fanatic. When he fell from true cosmic status and became a mere Ordainer, his mind shrank as well as his power. The Critic of the Cosmos became a mere shadow of his former self. His love of structure and planning hardened into a blind hatred of disobedience and “messiness.” Even most of Urizen’s mortal servants think that Bromion is a bit extreme, for he labors to eliminate free will so no one will ever disobey Urizen’s Law. Superhe- roes and supervillains, with their unusual powers, gaudy costumes, and often-unrestrained conduct, embody the worst aspects of free will and, in Bromion’s opinion, need to be destroyed or “fixed” as soon as possible.
The Lord of Order’s impulse to tidiness rivals his drive to capture and “correct” rebellious mortals. The GM should make Unluck checks to mediate Bromion’s dueling Psychological Compli- cations: if Bromion rolls even a single point of Unluck, his neatness fetish forces him to break off combat and repair damage to the Millworks (or other places he’s organized).
Deep down, Bromion knows his defection was wrong. Servants of Art painfully remind him of his former state. If a mystic dedicated to Artifice shows any sympathy, Bromion tries recruiting him to the side of Order so the mystic’s defection will confirm his own. Bromion makes a special effort to destroy Servants of Art who scorn or mock Order.
Quote: “All evil is disobedience and disharmony. Without free will, there can be no evil. Submit!”

Powers/Tactics: Bromion no longer commands the incalculable power he once possessed as a conceptual entity, but his magical powers remain vast. His ability to shape thoughts curdled into a set of spells, the Bindings Of Bromion, for brute- force control of others. He also knows several other spells, either generic or developed by other Lords of Order.
In combat, Bromion typically uses one of his defensive Multipower slots, then devotes the
rest of his Multipower reserve to an attack slot. He favors spells that prevent opponents from fighting back, then unleashes spells to inflict STUN once he restrains all his foes. Bromion uses his Broad Blast or Area Mind Control only
if he loses his temper. He uses his Power Pool to create special senses or defenses; for instance, an Enhanced Sense to see through his own Cloud Of Unknowing, or a special defense to block an NND attack.
Bromion’s importance to the cohorts of Order rests on his knowledge of magical smithcraft. He can create powerful magic items or completely transform a captive. Bromion can make a person as fanatically devoted to Order as he is, and even give them superpowers. Bromion prefers to work his smithcraft through the Millworks: once the Ordainer sets the Millworks machinery to a task, it and Bromion’s drone servants can finish the job with no further supervision. (Obviously, this is something of a “plot device” ability, not a power that you should let PCs have!)
The Ordainer can do nearly anything a plot demands, if he has time to prepare the Millworks. For instance, Bromion can spy on other dimen- sions or look through time if the GM so desires, forcibly transport other beings to the Millworks, create magical superweapons, or assemble special- purpose Automaton minions. If Bromion expects an invasion of the Millworks, he re-organizes his Base with lots of traps and other defenses to repel intruders. (In game terms, the Millworks has a large Variable Power Pool for these things.)
Campaign Use: Bromion serves as a second-tier dimensional menace. He operates more subtly than Skarn or Tyrannon since he lacks their raw power — he typically seeks to convert leaders to his point of view and subvert or destroy mystics who could stop him, rather than launch an open invasion. The Ordainer is also a little less crazy or implacable than mega-villains such as Tyrannon, the Dragon, or the Kings of Edom. He’s a fanatic, but characters might find ways to play on his obsessions and so gain short-term help against some greater menace.
To make Bromion more powerful, increase his SPD and END so he can launch more attacks in a Turn without exhausting himself. You could also increase his spell attacks’ DCs, or make his Divine Power VPP. To make him less powerful, reduce his attacks to 60-some Active Points and lower his innate defenses.
The obsessed Ordainer is extremely
likely to Hunt characters who interfere
with his plans. Bromion usually delegates
this task to spirits or superpowered mortals
he captured and brainwashed, but he might
set a trap for enemy mystics or engage in more devious schemes to capture a foe. He seldom kills captured enemies; the Lord of Order would rather convert them, whether by reason or soul-smithing.
Appearance: Bromion’s head and arms look
like those of a normal human. He has a narrow face. His lips are usually pursed in disapproval. Swirling, faceted robes cover the rest of his body. He could be thin or fat, tall or short. In addition to his shining, pastel robes, Bromion wears a cylin- drical white headdress and a large, golden brooch.
Under his Ordainer’s robes, Bromion is actually quite brawny: pumping bellows and swinging a hammer for a few eternities keeps even a spirit in good shape. But no physical, magical, or mental force can remove Bromion’s robes — they’re part of his self-image and therefore part of Bromion himself.
The Bindings Of Bromion take the form of rhomboids of colored light. Most of his other spells are generic globes and beams of light. His big repair spell has an especially impressive special effect: a miles-high phantom image of Bromion appears, and tendrils of white light spread out from its fingers. As the tendrils move through the Millworks, damage to the machinery disappears.

THe MILLWORKs
Bromion’s Base is a plane called the Millworks. This dimen- sion, a Yetziratic realm in the sephiroth of Netzach, consists of two interpenetrating spaces. The first space is a vast foundry
and machine shop full of gears, lathes, furnaces, triphammers, and conveyer belts, lit by gas jets and vats of molten metal. The second space is mostly empty and lit by sourceless, clear white light. Huge, silvery spheres ranging from 100 to 200 feet in diam- eter hang in the void. Irregular, rounded holes in the spheres give access to the second space. Occasionally a conveyer belt, chain, or curving bridge of silver metal reaches between spheres.
The machine space has normal gravity and lots of catwalks to walk upon. The sphere space seems to have normal gravity — a fixed “up” and “down” — but a person can walk around in empty space as if there was a floor. Effectively, a character’s Running becomes an equal amount of Flight. If a person wants to move up or down, he walks up or down an imaginary stairway. If a person stands still for more than a few seconds, a disk of silvery metal two meters in diameter grows under his feet. Such disks vanish shortly after people leave them.
A race of bizarre humanoids tends the Millworks. These creatures have the legs and head of a horse and a four-armed humanoid torso, but are covered in shiny black chitin and have large compound eyes, like an insect. These workers never tire and obey Bromion without question. They are also completely devoid of original thought: they do only what Bromion commands, even to the point of letting someone kill them because Bromion didn’t order them to defend themselves.
Bromion and his workers try to capture all intruders and “reprocess” them in the machines to turn them into loyal servants of Order. This involves melting captives down in special furnaces and casting a new person from the resulting soul-metal.

BROMION FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Bromion if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll. The best Skills for this would be KS: The Mystic World, KS: Cosmic Beings, or the like; Bromion doesn’t usually mingle with the full Superhuman World.
N/R: Bromion is a dimensional lord; he rules a realm called the Mill- works. He favors order, planning, and discipline, and fights anything he considers disharmony, disobedience, or chaos.
K/R: Bromion was once a powerful Lord of Artifice, but he sinned against his fellow lords of Art after becoming too enamored with the Order promoted by the Zoa Urizen; he was captured, but escaped by renouncing most of his power and becoming one of Urizen’s Ordainers.
-1: Bromion created a series of spells, the Bindings Of Bromion, for restraining people that have since passed into the general body of Thaumaturgy used by mystics throughout the Multiverse.
-2: Bromion typically prefers to restrain or capture attackers and intruders, then render them unconscious, then use the machinery of the Millworks to “remake” them as obedient servants of Order.
-6: Chaos magic has a strong effect on Bromion, and just being in a place consecrated to Chaos causes him pain.
