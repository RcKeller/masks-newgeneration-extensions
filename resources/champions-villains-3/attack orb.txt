SYZYGY FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Syzygy if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Syzygy is an evil robot that intends to conquer humanity. In addition to its built-in weapons, it has twelve “followers” in the form of robotic orbs that “orbit” its body and have their own weaponry to attack its foes with.
K/R: In addition to a standard blaster, Syzygy’s weapons include a gravitic manipulator that allows it to move objects without touching them, and an energy shackle projector.
-6: Syzygy’s computer brain is so sophisticated that standard psionic powers can affect it, and cyberkinetic powers are unusually effective against it.
-10: Syzygy was created by an alien civilization (it’s unclear which one, and it doesn’t even know due to interference with its programming).
