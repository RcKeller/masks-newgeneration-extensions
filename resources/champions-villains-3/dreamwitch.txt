DREAMWITCH
Background/History: Karen Knox was a college student majoring in biology who suffered from frequent bouts of insomnia. Her constant sleepi- ness made it difficult for her to pay attention in class or participate in extracurricular activities, and she was frequently grumpy due to lack of sleep.
After standard remedies for insomnia failed to work, Karen turned to an experimental therapy being developed by Professor Radko Pilevic of Millennium City University. Even though it hadn’t been fully tested, much less approved by the FDA, at that point she was desperate enough to try anything.
Professor Pilevic’s treatment worked — but
not the way either of them expected. Instead of making it possible for her to sleep normally, the treatment “solved” her problem by making it
not only unnecessary for her to sleep, but impos- sible for her to sleep. Her body and mind no longer needed the energy or relaxation... at least
in theory. Despite the treatment’s efficacy, after several weeks of not sleeping Karen began to suffer from a deteriorating mental state.
And then her mental state simply changed.
She began developing strange powers to manipu- late sleep and dreams in other people. Instead of having her own dreams she could live in others’
— or change them, if she preferred. She could make people fall asleep with just a thought, or make them so tired they could barely function. No longer caring anything for society or its mores, she decided to use her powers for personal gain as the villainous Dreamwitch.
Personality/Motivation: The Dreamwitch is not mentally stable. While she still retains the core of her basic personality (among other things, she’d never think of killing anyone), for the most part she doesn’t care about society’s rules and laws, freely violating them for her own gain or pleasure.
Furthermore, because the Dreamwitch cannot sleep (and thus cannot dream), dangerous levels
of “dream energy” build up in her. She has to alleviate this psychic pressure by using her Dream- weaving power on another person at least once per day; otherwise the dream-images flooding her mind drive her to distraction.
Quote: “Sleep tight, little man.”
Powers/Tactics: As superhuman combatants go, the Dreamwitch is relatively nonviolent — her attacks involve putting people peacefully to sleep, or causing them to experience waking dreams (or nightmares). She’d rather not use the latter powers if she doesn’t have to, but sometimes they’re neces- sary. Most of the time she relies on her various forms of Sleep Infliction. If a fight starts to go badly she flies away, and if possible flees into a nearby dreamscape.

Campaign Use: Besides using her simply as a thematic mentalist villain, you can make the Dreamwitch a gateway to adventures in the Dreamzone. Through her, or because of her,
the characters can (or have to) venture into the twisted dreamscapes of criminals, supervillains, politicians, generals, and heaven knows who else.
If the Dreamwitch isn’t tough enough to pose a challenge to your PCs, give her the power to trans- form herself into a dream-like or semi-dream-like form (Desolidification, Damage Reduction). If she’s too powerful already, get rid of Sleep Inflic- tion III and reduce her SPD by 1-2 points.
The Dreamwitch generally doesn’t Hunt characters. She’d probably only develop a vendetta against one with similar powers whom she feels is encroaching on her “turf.”
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: The Dream- witch is an ideal ally for supervillains who are more interested in getting a job done quickly
and cleanly than in hurting people, and she often works with that type of criminal. For example she’s allied with GRAB on several occasions; she’d certainly be on the “short list” for recruitment if that group ever decides to expand its ranks.
Appearance: The Dreamwitch is a pale-skinned white woman, 5’7” tall with long auburn hair that she keeps out of her face with a sort of three- pronged tiara. Her costume is burgundy and gold.
