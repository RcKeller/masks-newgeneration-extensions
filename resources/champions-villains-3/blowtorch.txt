Powers/Tactics: Blowtorch uses a modified high- tech flamethrower. The weapon has a variety of settings he controls by pressing buttons with his thumb or carefully squeezing the variable-use trigger. He can fire a concentrated stream of flame, larger balls or cones of flame, or a series of large gouts of flame. Perhaps most interestingly, he can soak a person in unburned fuel, then with the tiniest flick of the trigger, send a spark down the fuel stream to immolate the target. (This is bought as a Constant Uncontrolled attack, with Reduced Endurance even though the Flamethrower uses Charges, to represent how the victim keeps burning until the fire is put out.)
The Flamethrower uses a special form of highly- concentrated jet fuel, but in a pinch, Blowtorch can fill the tank with ordinary gasoline to replenish his Charges (reduce each slot’s damage by 1-2 DCs, or perhaps more, to simulate the lower-quality fuel). Unfortunately, the weapon can be as dangerous
to Blowtorch as to his enemies. If it takes even a single BODY of damage past its defenses from an energy attack (or any other attack that could ignite the fuel), it bursts into flame, causing Blowtorch to take 2d6 damage every Phase (no defense) until the flames are extinguished.
In combat, Blowtorch normally relies on his Concentrated Firestream attack most of the time, switching to the others only when he can take out multiple targets or obtain some other tactical advantage — the other settings all use up fuel much more quickly. If he loses his flamethrower, he can fall back on his martial arts training.
Campaign Use: For the most part Blowtorch is a run-of-the-mill mercenary villain who hires himself out for jobs where he might have the chance to start fires. (This includes, of course, any arson job; he’s a highly sought-after expert at those.) However, his pyromania puts an interesting spin on things; he may compromise his employer’s mission if he can’t resist the opportunity to start a little fire.
If Blowtorch isn’t strong enough to stand
up to the heroes in your game, give him more incendiary weapons — maybe even ones built into his costume so they can’t be taken away from him or destroyed easily. Some more Resistant Protection might help him, too. If he’s too strong or dangerous, tone down his High-Tech Flame- thrower until he’s a viable, but not overwhelming, opponent.
Appearance: Blowtorch wears a charcoal-grey costume with a dark orange “flame” design licking up his arms and legs from his boots and gloves. His half-face mask is also dark grey, with the flame-orange around the eyes. His flamethrower’s fuel tanks are strapped to his back, and connect to the rifle via an armored hose.
Out of costume, Perry Johnson is a 5’6” white man of average appearance in his mid-thirties. He has sandy blonde hair, hazel eyes, and a runner’s build. He usually carries a few cigarette lighters and has a nervous habit of flicking them on, staring at the flame for a couple of seconds, then flicking them off.
