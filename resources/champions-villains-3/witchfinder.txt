WITCHFINDER
Background/History: One night, little Jeremy Blaine’s comfortable, middle- class childhood came crashing down. He and his parents were caught in Takofanes’s debut march across the United States. The Archlich slew Jeremy’s parents and reanimated them as part of his army of the dead. Perhaps he didn’t see Jeremy cowering behind
a dumpster; perhaps he simply didn’t need a small boy zombie. Jeremy didn’t appreciate the favor.
Jeremy grew up in foster care. He became a top student and star athlete
in high school, but he turned down
all the offers he received from college recruiters. On his eighteenth birthday, he inherited his parents’ modest savings and used the money for a 5-year trip around the world. He visited private libraries and esoteric sages, martial arts trainers and weaponsmiths. At the end he was ready to begin his life’s work.
That meeting with Takofanes taught Jeremy that devils walked the night, and the worst of all were the devils in human form who treated with the Dark Powers. He lost his parents to black magic, but he could stop the magicians from claiming any more victims... by killing them all first.
Personality/Motivation: Witchfinder cannot forgive himself for living while his parents died, and his irrational guilt fuels his hatred of all sorcerers and supernatural creatures. He wants to purge all magic from the world
— kill the wizards, burn their books and sanctums, and destroy their artifacts — or die in the attempt. He sees all other supernatural creatures
as pawns of the mystics, and tries to destroy them as well. The Witchfinder may spare a few magic items if they help him kill mystics, but he plans to destroy them too, once the last sorcerer is dead. If one mystic escapes a few of his ambushes, the Witchfinder might become so obsessed with that partic- ular character that he would use any magic — even make his own pact with a supernatural being — just to kill his nemesis.
Quote: ““Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live” — so you can suffer and die!”

Powers/Tactics: Witchfinder is a hyper-competent man with a lot of paramilitary hardware: guns, grenades, explosives, and similar ironmongery.
He has a weapon that can kill, or at least hurt,
just about anything supernatural. He even carries special holy water grenades to use on vampires and demons. If the Witchfinder believes a creature suffers a special weakness (such as silver for werewolves or salt for zombies), he creates special ammunition loaded or coated with that substance. He can also create traps, from letter bombs to sunlight-channeling fiber optic cables.
The Witchfinder owns a pair of ornate bracers that parry spells, glow to point the direction of magic, and grant him limited defense against some mystical forces. He doesn’t know that Mephistoph- eles arranged for him to find the bracers and can turn them off whenever he wants. The Witchfinder won’t get a chance to kill Mephisto’s most favored servants — just their competition.

The Witchfinder never openly challenges the mystics or creatures he hunts. He stalks them, learning their habits so he can find an opportunity to attack with complete surprise. He may settle
for shooting a sorcerer through the head from a rooftop, but he prefers to leave a messy corpse as a warning about what other people can expect
if they meddle with the Black Arts. If his target doesn’t die quickly, he flees to try again later.
Campaign Use: The Witchfinder talks a lot about the menace of magic, but he’s quite a menace himself. He’s no heroic but misguided monster- hunter; he’s a maniac who burns down New Age bookstores with the customers locked inside, just to “make a statement.” Mystical PCs not only need to protect themselves from the Witchfinder, they need to protect everyone near them, or anyone who simply shows an interest in the supernatural.
If the Witchfinder isn’t powerful enough to threaten the characters, give him better weapons or Targeting Skill Levels so he can reliably shoot victims in the head or vitals. He may also need Extra DCs with his Jujutsu and higher DEX and defenses. If the Witchfinder is too lethal, remove his Combat Skill Levels — but remember, the whole point with this character is to challenge the PCs with a foe who strikes without warning and from a distance.
The Witchfinder Hunts every supernatural creature or mystic. If mystical PCs attract his attention, he tries to kill them. If they survive his first attack, he tries to kill them again, and again, until he thinks he’s succeeded or the heroes catch him.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Witch- finder can only relate to people who can share his crusade. For example, Nebula or Thunderbird might team up with him to stop mystic villains, though he probably wouldn’t return the favor by helping them with mundane criminals.
Naturally, nearly all mystics and supernatu- rals hate, and often fear, Witchfinder. DEMON
is only the most prominent group that wants the Witchfinder dead because of his attacks on it. The Demonologist in particular would like to see him removed from this mortal coil; the Witchfinder stands squarely in the way of the progress of the Dark Renaissance.
Appearance: The Witchfinder is a wiry man of middle height in his late thirties. He has crewcut brown hair, grey eyes, and a brooding expression. He wears a big game hunter-style ammunition vest and belt hung with grenades and tool pouches, over a camo-patterned flak suit. He also wears a military helmet with high-tech goggles. His fore- arms bear teardrop-shaped bracers enameled with three sigils and a twisty border.
