Background/History: Lincoln Connors was a geologist who specialized in the study of earth- quakes and related phenomena. His ultimate goal was to find a way to not only predict earthquakes, but prevent or minimize them. He was something of a maverick in the scientific community; his peers regarded him as a grandiose dreamer whose theories were dubious at best.
After years of work, Connors made a breakthrough, developing a technology
he called Seismic Amplification and Redirection (SAR). By installing SAR generators along a faultline, he believed
he could amplify and redirect a quake event to negate it. He finally convinced a scientific journal to publish his findings, but other scientists mocked them, pointing out numerous flaws in his theories and designs.
Determined to show those ignorant fools
who was the better scientist, Connors secretly built and installed several SAR generators along the San Andreas Fault in California. They acti- vated as planned when the next minor quake hit, and they amplified the quake “wave” properly... but they completely failed to redirect it, just like his rivals had predicted. Instead of negating the quake, Connors made it worse, causing millions of dollars in property damage and the loss of nearly a dozen lives.
With the authorities on his tail, Connors went into hiding. He soon realized that he’d never get
a fair chance to prove that his technology worked — it had just been a trivial miscalculation, that was all, but no one would ever believe that. He was going to have to force the world to acknowledge his genius and the fact that he could save thou- sands of lives if given the proper funding.
The next time the world saw Lincoln Connors he was wearing a massive, bronze-colored suit
of powered armor. Built onto each forearm were large “vibro-cannons” that incorporated his SAR technology in a way no one could ignore or down- play. Calling himself SARGON, he destroyed one of his critics’ labs in what can only be described
as a spectacular proof that his technology worked (at least in one way). Since then he’s become a mercenary supervillain, always looking for more ways to earn money that he can use to improve his designs... and, eventually, stop that big quake he knows is coming.
Personality/Motivation: SARGON has convinced himself that he’s become a “villain” for the ultimate good of mankind, so he can predict and prevent earthquakes, but that’s just talk. The truth is he’s did it initially for his ego, to prove that he was right and everyone else was wrong. And he’s still doing it for that reason — he loves to show that he’s the best and brightest, that no one can ever truly defeat him, that he’ll always be proven right in the end — but beyond that he’s secretly come
to enjoy the life of a supervillain. He’d never
admit it to anyone, but he loves blasting smug, self-righteous heroes and destroying buildings.
It gives him an even greater feeling of power than he’d ever have gotten from taming an earthquake.
Quote: “By the time I’m done with you, there won’t be anything left but a puddle of quivering goo.”
Powers/Tactics: The SARGON powered armor suit is equipped with two vibro-cannons of SARGON’s own design. Depending on how he tunes them, they can emit an ordinary beam or a cone of vibratory energy, a beam that both injures and sickens living beings, a beam that causes
an intense localized earthquake-like phenom- enon, or a vibratory pulse that can shake rigid objects to pieces. When the cannons won’t do the trick, SARGON also has two three-missile pods mounted on his shoulders and a laser beam weapon built into his right gauntlet.
SARGON usually prefers to open up with one of his Area Of Effect attacks to keep his enemies off-balance. Then he targets individual enemies with his Anti-Personnel or Standard beams. If confronted with a vehicle or the like, he’ll use Shaken Apart to destroy it.

Campaign Use: SARGON is a fairly typical mercenary supervillain with a background grudge to keep things interesting. He could show up just about anywhere working for nearly anyone.
To make SARGON more powerful, give him some bootjets so he can fly, another point of SPD, and two more weapons (an Entangle and a Sight Group Flash). To weaken him, reduce his Endurance Reserve to 120 END, 12 REC and his SPD to 4.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: SARGON’s relatively new to the Superhuman World and hasn’t worked with a lot of other villains yet.
He’s teamed up with Armadillo a couple times, accepted a few jobs from VIPER, things like that. He’s on the lookout for a major job he can pull on his own to increase his “rep” and bring better employers to his doorstep.
Appearance: The SARGON suit of powered
battle armor makes wearer over seven feet tall. It’s mostly a dull bronze color, with a few highlights in brighter shades of bronze here and there. The whole suit has a heavy, ponderous look to it with such touches as heavy metal bands at the shoulder joints adorned with thick blunt spikes, a helmet that merges into the body of the armor without a distinct neck, and a thick belt with large rectan- gular “blocks” (power packs) attached to it verti- cally. But what really stand out are the weapons: the large blaster cannons mounted on each forearm, the three-missile pods on each shoulder, and more.

SARGON FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about SARGON if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: SARGON is a powered armor-wearing villain; his armor incorporates two powerful “vibro- cannons” as well as lasers, mini-missiles, and other weaponry.
K/R: SARGON’s vibro-cannons emit vibratory blasts that can seriously injure someone, cause nausea and vertigo, or even cause tiny localized earthquake-like events.
-2: SARGON can’t fly; his armor incorporates jump-jets that allow him to make leaps of 20 meters or more.
-10: His Secret Identity is Lincoln Connors; he’s a geologist specializing in the study of earthquakes.
