Background/History: Valak, Ravager Of Worlds, is widely regarded by many interstellar societies as a myth — a story told to younglings at bedtime to persuade them to be good or Valak will get them. But a few planets have learned, to their eternal sorrow, that there’s a great deal of truth behind the tales.
Valak was born centuries ago on a world some- where in the Sextans dwarf galaxy some 300,000 light-years from Earth. A powerful mutant among his own race, he conquered his homeworld with ease, then sent his armies forth to do the same
to nearby planets. A group of worlds formed an alliance against him, and their combined armies overwhelmed his own, destroying them and reducing his planet to rubble. But Valak himself escaped, and over the next several centuries attacked each of those worlds in turn individu- ally, destroying their armies, overthrowing their governments, and slaying millions.
Finally his enemies were defeated, but Valak still burned with an unquenchable rage and desire for combat. He left the burning worlds of his home system and headed out into space, determined
to bring the glory of war and destruction to each and every one of the stars that shone in the night sky. Eventually his travels brought him to human- ity’s portion of the Milky Way Galaxy, where
he destroyed several minor civilizations before being trapped by the combined efforts of dozens of Star*Guards and imprisoned at the center of a small planetoid.
It took Valak many years to escape, but at last he did, and began traveling from Star*Guard outpost to outpost, killing everyone he found.
By the time he was approaching the Sol system
in May 2006 CONTROL had figured out what had happened and sent a message to Earth’s Star*Guard... which he received while he was in New York assisting the Sentinels. They accom- panied him into space in an attempt to slow Valak down and save Star*Guard’s support crew. Fortunately, his escape efforts and long years without sustenance had weakened Valak, so the heroes were able to defeat him in an epic battle that ranged from the orbit of Jupiter to the streets of New York City. Valak once again found himself imprisoned, this time via “hot sleep” in Strong- hold; his armor and Cosmic Halberd were sent to the Goodman Institute for study.
There Valak remained for three years... and then Menton broke free from hot sleep. To cover his own escape he freed most of the other inmates, including Valak. After first smashing his way into the Goodman Institute’s labs to retrieve his posses- sions, he left the Earth. No one’s seen him since
— but neither Earth’s heroes nor the Star*Guard believe they’ve seen the last of him.
Personality/Motivation: Valak has precisely one dimension to his personality: he lives to fight and to kill, preferably in the most spectacular way possible so that his name is spread far and wide. Everything else has been burned away by centuries of rage and conflict. Nothing makes him happier than the sight of crowds running away from him, except perhaps for the placing of his enemies’ heads on pikes. He really enjoys that.
Quote: “Well done, little man! I nearly felt that. You should be honored, as your suffering will now be legendary!”
Powers/Tactics: Valak’s character sheet shows him at only a fraction of his original power level — it cost him much to break out of the Star*Guard’s prison. But even at that he’s a terrifying opponent, with vast strength, dangerous psionic abilities,
and a Cosmic Halberd he took from one of his conquests; it can cut through nearly anything. He has little use for tactics beyond “attack without respite until your opponents fall before you.”
Campaign Use: Valak as he is now is a dangerous opponent for most teams. If he ever finds an appropriate power source, or simply takes a decade or two to recover from being imprisoned, you should increase his abilities until he’s a threat not just to your team of PCs, but to an entire world’s worth of hero teams — the sort of menace that the heroes have to team up with master villains like Dr. Destroyer and Yin Wu to defeat.
Appearance: Valak the World-Ravager is a humanoid alien nearly eight feet tall with navy blue skin. Compared to a Human’s his head is slightly disproportionately large, with a mouthful of sharp light blue teeth and a series of distinc- tive furrows running from the bridge of his nose to halfway across his bald scalp. His hands have three fingers and a thumb, his feet four toes. He wears a burnt orange bodysuit with sleeves that end halfway down his forearms, and heavy black boots. He carries a Cosmic Halberd, a polearm- like weapon whose oddly-shaped bladed head
is surrounded by a field of purple-black energy motes that allow it to cut through almost anything.
VALAK THE WORLD-RAVAGER FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Valak the World-Ravager if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Valak is an immensely powerful alien super- villain who exists only to fight, destroy, and kill. He wields a powerful Cosmic Halberd as his chief weapon, but he also has psionic powers.
K/R: Valak is actually from another Galaxy. He and the Star*Guard are fierce enemies. At full strength he’s powerful enough to take on dozens of superheroes at once and to destroy entire planets; fortunately his years in hot sleep seem to have weakened him for the time being.
