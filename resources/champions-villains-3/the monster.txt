Background/History: No one knows who the Monster is, where it came from, or who sent it. It simply appeared, one dark and stormy night, and began its reign of bloodshed and terror. Its skull- like face, glowing an evil green, is the last thing many people see. With claws that drip blood, it has left scores of corpses in his wake. The last time it ravaged the city, superheroes barely stopped
it; next time they may not be able to contain it at all....
Personality/Motivation: The Monster is pure, unwavering evil. It exists only to destroy, kill, maim, and wreak havoc. Its mind is so full of evil thoughts and images that telepaths who establish psychic contact with it experience severe pain.
Quote: None. The Monster rarely communicates with anything except a roar of anger or a deep- throated chuckle of fiendish glee.
Powers/Tactics: The Monster attacks quickly, aggressively, and persistently. It usually opens the battle with a Presence Attack, especially in favor- able conditions (e.g., while standing on a rooftop, silhouetted by the moon), then takes advantage of its victims’ hesitation by ripping into them with its claws. Sweep attacks with its claws are not uncommon. If it can’t close to HTH Combat distance, it uses its STR to throw the heaviest objects it can find.
If the battle goes against the Monster, it tries to seize a hostage (a woman, if possible) and force the PCs to pursue it to get her back, or save her while it escapes. Sometimes it does this just for fun, carefully concealing the fact that it’s already injured the victim so badly the heroes haven’t a prayer of saving her even if they get her back.
Campaign Use: The Monster is a “gothic super- horror” type of villain, and you should use him accordingly. Adventures involving it should take place in dark, haunted mansions, on stormy mountaintops, in shadowy alleyways, and other such places. Its appearance in the game should cause not only concern, but terror, on the part
of the PCs. If it’s not tough enough to challenge them, increase its STR, SPD, and HKA until its name becomes synonymous with death and fear. (On the other hand, if it’s already powerful enough to gut all the PCs effortlessly, tone it back a little by reducing its STR and HKA; it should be really tough, but not unstoppable.)
The primary plot hook connected with the Monster is what it is and where it comes from. It could be a demon, a man possessed by a demon, a robot, a golem, a mutant, an alien, or some combination of the above. You should also decide who created/unleashed it, and why; its actions don’t seem to indicate any purpose other than committing evil acts, but there may be a pattern the heroes cannot yet perceive.

Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Some officials have speculated that there may be a link between the Monster and the Reaper (page 235). They’re wrong, but the idea has taken hold in some sectors of the Superhuman World and may lead to some plans being made that will fail due to the misunderstanding.
Appearance: Standing nearly seven feet tall, the Monster is huge and frightening. Its face looks like an evilly-glowing green skull, and its large hands are tipped with sharp claws that seem to drip blood constantly. It wears clothes, including a floppy hat and large cloak, that appear to be made of charred leather.

-4: The Monster’s mind is so evil and cruel that making psionic contact with him causes mentalists pain.
