Background/History: Cong Feng’s history at Yengtao Temple and his role as the destroyer of the Temple are chronicled on CU 63, 120. His life before that time remains a mystery to all save himself, and he refuses to talk about the matter.
Following his destruction of Yengtao Temple and murder of all of its masters, Cong drifted to Hong Kong, where he put his martial arts skills to work for the Triad gangs. After a year or two of this, he tired of taking orders from others and decided to establish his own criminal empire. However, the Triads had Hong Kong sewn up, so he decided the only thing left to do was go to America, land of opportunity.
Cong arrived in Millennium City and set up
a small shop in Chinatown selling martial arts supplies and similar equipment. He did not, however, establish his own dojo; he had no inten- tion of teaching his martial arts secrets to lesser men. At night he worked in the underworld, first for a couple of tongs (to build a “war chest” and a reputation), but eventually only for himself. Today he’s a superhuman mercenary, but with an eye toward becoming a power in the Asian under- world — a dangerous counterpoint to the tongs and the yakuza.
Cong didn’t choose Millennium City at random. Having correctly guessed that Nightwind was his old rival Steve Chase, he came to Millen- nium City to continue their long contest — one he knows will eventually end in Chase’s defeat. The two have clashed several times since then, but never conclusively.
Personality/Motivation: Jade Phoenix is vicious, crude, hot-tempered, arrogant, racist, sadistic,
and ambitious — the perfect combination for a super-mercenary and potential crimelord. In addi- tion, he’s murderously jealous of anyone whose martial arts prowess (particularly with Kung Fu) even approaches his own; he’ll try to kill or cripple any such fighters. It was this envy that led him to destroy Yengtao Temple.
Quote: “Ha ha ha ha ha! Is that the best you can do? Let me teach you the true meaning of martial arts mastery!”
Powers/Tactics: Jade Phoenix is a master of Kung Fu. He has trained in it for most of his life, and has studied all of its major substyles and many lesser- known substyles. Additionally, through hard work and great effort, he has mastered his ch’i. This gives him a variety of powers: the ability to run up walls or along narrow branches; dim mak strikes; the power to slash the air in front of him and project a wave of “sword energy” to strike his foe; and more.
Jade Phoenix usually favors an all-out offense in combat, and prefers kicks to punches. He keeps his Combat Skill Levels in OCV and uses them
to take Placed Shots to vulnerable locations (the head, the vitals) unless it becomes apparent his opponent can hit him easily — in which case he switches to defensive fighting, since he doesn’t have the PD and ED to absorb a lot of damage. He also likes to use his Acrobatics and movement powers to move around his opponents and attack them from behind or other favorable positions.
Campaign Use: Jade Phoenix can play many roles in your campaign. The most obvious is that of super-mercenary, but you can take him beyond that if you want. First, he could become the arch- enemy of a martial artist PC; just substitute the PC for Nightwind as the object of his greatest hatred and adjust his background accordingly. Second, if you give him some Followers and other Perks, you can turn him into more of a crimelord.
If Jade Phoenix doesn’t have the power to match your PCs, give him more Extra DCs, more ch’i powers (see Chapter Three of HSMA for ideas), or both. If he’s too powerful already, reduce his Characteristics and Extra DCs as appropriate, and perhaps discard some of his more esoteric ch’i powers (including Sword Energy).
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Jade Phoenix views anyone who might challenge the superiority of Kung Fu, or his superiority as a martial artist, as a threat to be eliminated. That includes Cheshire Cat (who’s made a number of mocking comments about him), Green Dragon, Spirit Fist, and several other members of the supervillain community.
