Background/History: The identity, background, and history of the man known to the world as Taipan remain a mystery to UNTIL and other authorities despite over a decade of investiga-
tion. What law enforcement officials around the world do know is the record of his activities since his first known appearance in 1997 — an attack that left three Melbourne superheroes and two civilians dead. That attack was apparently carried out for purposes of publicity, and it did the trick. Taipan was hired for numerous other assassination jobs, including over a dozen successful missions involving superhuman targets, during the next three years. It’s believed his employers during that time included VIPER, the Warlord, and several rogue governments and terrorist groups. As far
as the authorities can tell, his only motivation
is money; for a minimum fee of $10 million, he guarantees that whoever his employer wants killed will soon wind up very, very dead.
The only time he ever failed to live up to that guarantee was his last job in 2000, when a person or persons unknown, but suspected to be VIPER, hired him to murder the Peacekeepers. His initial attack killed two of them, the hyper-adrenaline- powered Fury and the “living robot” Transac,
but the team regrouped, fought back effectively, and ultimately laid him low with one of the few things that can be as fast as he is: psionic powers. Rapture’s mental control overwhelmed his will- power enough to slow him down so Dwarfstar could beat him into deep unconsciousness.
Before Taipan could wake up, the Peacekeepers arranged for him to be put into one of PRIMUS’s portable temporary “hot sleep” chambers pending a hearing. The hearing determined that he was sufficiently dangerous to merit hot sleep incarcera- tion pending trial. Following a hearing before the World Court, nations with cases pending against him agreed to consolidate all cases for trial in Australia, the site of his first killings.
Taipan was awakened for his trial but bound with neuro-shackles that prevented him from moving or using his powers. His attorney, world-famous criminal defense lawyer Marvin Hendrickson (a.ka. “VIPER’s Mouthpiece”), labored mightily on his behalf, but after an eight- week trial he was convicted of nearly two dozen counts of murder in the first degree. The sentence: hot sleep confinement for the duration of his life.
Aware of the special danger posed by this pris- oner, the government of Australia constructed a special prison in the Outback. Located a hundred miles from anything, this facility has but one prisoner: Taipan. A squad of highly-paid guards with full UNTIL training and weaponry stand watch over him and the prison’s state of the art security systems. Ever since then he’s remained there, asleep but not dreaming, as his life slowly but surely ticks away.
Personality/Motivation: Taipan is a hardened, emotionless killer. He has no sympathy or compassion for anyone but himself, seeing people more in terms of the challenge they present as assassination targets than as human beings. The only human emotion he’s known to feel is loyalty; an employer who hires him can count on his abso- lute professionalism and discretion.
Quote: None. Taipan is not known to have spoken with any of his victims.
Powers/Tactics: Taipan’s nervous system is hyper- accelerated, giving him blindingly fast reflexes and tremendous speed. In combat he’s one of the fastest and deadliest men in the world, which is why the Australian government has spared no expense to ensure that he remains in hot sleep for the rest of his life.
Using this speed, Taipan brings to bear a wide variety of attacks. The deadliest is Taipan’s Bite, a venomous touch attack. He seems to generate the venom within his body, though he can only create a limited supply every day. In addition to that he seems to have studied a wide variety of fighting arts and maneuvers, and can hurl objects as hyper- velocity missiles.
Taipan’s attacks usually take the form of quick, lethal ambushes — he’s not interested in extended combat, though he’s certainly proven himself capable of taking on entire teams of experienced superhumans and wreaking havoc among them. He usually tries to take his target out with a Taipan’s Bite (possibly combined with a Lethal Strike as a Multiple Attack, just to be sure), then moves on to other targets or makes his escape,

as the situation warrants. He doesn’t usually encounter opposition he can’t handle, but if he does he retreats and tries again later.
Campaign Use: Taipan is a lurking threat you can dangle over the PCs’ heads. They just know that sooner or later he’s going to escape and get back in the game, and when that time comes it will somehow fall to them to track down and capture a man who’s killed over a dozen superhumans.
Taipan should be frighteningly deadly; even the most powerful of your PCs should hesitate before taking him on. If he’s not at that pinnacle yet, beef him up until he makes them quake in their boots. One good way to make him tougher is to give him some Mental Defense and Power Defense; right now he’s essentially defenseless against Mental Powers and Drains, which gives the heroes a way to take him out but may prove to be too great an Achilles’s heel. If he’s already too likely to over- whelm your PCs, start trimming points of SPD and DCs in his attacks until he’s deadly, but not a campaign-breaker.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Taipan’s been in hot sleep so long that he has no real relation- ships with the Superhuman World (and he never partnered with other superhumans when he was free). Prior to his capture VIPER, ARGENT,
and the Warlord all employed him on multiple occasions.
Appearance: Taipan wears a pale gold costume with brown stripes up the sides of the pants and sleeves; it covers his entire body (except for his eyes). His boots and skintight fingerless gloves are brown. On his chest is an image of a coiled snake ready to strike. The mask of his costume resembles the face of a snake with two black eyes and sharp white teeth surrounding the uncovered area, giving the impression that Taipan is looking out of the snake’s mouth.


TAIPAN FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Taipan if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Often referred to as “the world’s deadliest assassin,” Taipan is a superhumanly fast and strong killer who specializes in taking down superhuman targets. His main attack is the Taipan’s Bite, a venomous touch, but he’s also studied numerous martial arts styles and can turn nearly any object into a lethal thrown missile.
K/R: Taipan’s standard fee before his capture was $10 million per kill; VIPER, ARGENT, and the Warlord were among his most frequent employers.
-2: Taipan has no defense against psionic attacks (other than a strong will); that’s how the Peacekeepers defeated and captured him in 2000.
-4: Taipan can only use his “Taipan’s Bite” venomous touch attack four times per day.
