Background/History: Andrea Thompson was
an oceanographer studying currents, life, and geological formations in the deep ocean. To assist her work she developed a mini-sub that used a special force-field to resist the crushing pressures of the pelagic depths.
One day while she was exploring an ocean trench something went wrong aboard the sub. The force-field malfunctioned, reversing its polarity. Instead of keeping the pressure out, it channeled the pressure in. Ordinarily that would simply have reduced her to a lifeless pulp, but somehow the intense pressure infused her body. Although not fatal, the pain was intense, and she passed out.
When her team recovered the badly-damaged submarine by remote control, they were certain she’d be dead inside. But after they had the sub aboard ship, suddenly it exploded outward, its panels and struts seemingly ripped away by some outside force. Inside was Thompson... but she was different. Her skin was a strange shade of blue, and a look of harshness and cruelty marred her features. Before anyone could move or say anything she struck, pushing her former colleagues off the ship to die in the sea.
Soon a new supervillainess calling herself Gale- force was robbing and committing mayhem up and down the East Coast of the United States, and sometimes in western Europe. After a brief but destructive career, she was captured by the Capital Patrol in 2004 and sentenced to Stronghold. There she remained until 2009, when she escaped as part of Menton’s breakout. For a while she laid low in
a cave in the desert not far from the super-prison, but now she’s moved on and is ready to pick up where she left off.
Personality/Motivation: The accident that somehow gave Galeforce superpowers also altered her brain chemistry. A formerly ordinary woman dedicated to science and knowledge is now a cruel, vindictive criminal, full of anger and greed. She enjoys using her power to destroy as much as to rob, and particularly likes to see policemen and heroes helpless before her.
Quote: “This one’ll blow you away.”
Powers/Tactics: Although Galeforce is widely perceived as being an air/wind manipulator (an impression she’s fostered by her choice of name), in truth her power is the ability to control pressure broadly (she isn’t precise enough to, for example, have a straightforward Telekinesis-based power
to push small objects). By creating areas of high and low pressure she can cause “wind” to flow with tremendous speed and force away from her. By afflicting a specific target she can cause great pain, potentially lethal cases of “the bends,” or stop someone from moving.


Her signature power is to create a 2m wide gust of wind to push things away from her. She can
do this indefinitely, but only in one direction at a time. Because of this ability weak melee combat- ants may never be able to get close enough to hit her.
Galeforce has two weaknesses. First, her defenses are relatively low, though her pressure- enhanced body is much more durable than normal human flesh. Second, she has no move- ment abilities.
Campaign Use: Galeforce’s control of pressure
is an intriguing power, but may seem somewhat limited compared to many other characters (including the PCs she fights). If necessary, convert her to a pure wind manipulator and give her more powers (see the “Air/Wind Powers” section of Champions Powers for plenty of ideas). To weaken her, remove her Bends slot and reduce her SPD to 4.
Appearance: Galeforce is a twenty-something woman with Caucasian features, but her skin is light blue rather than white-pink, and she some- times decorates it with darker blue temporary tattoos of abstract line art. Her hair is that same shade of darker blue and cut short; she sometimes styles it spiky. Her costume consists of darker blue strips of cloth wrapped around her body, legs, and arms; this leaves a good bit of her skin showing, and she doesn’t wear a mask. A maelstrom of wind, sometimes light breezes but at other times strong enough to push a man backward, often surrounds her.

GALEFORCE FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Galeforce if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Galeforce is a supervillainess who controls air and wind.
K/R: Galeforce was imprisoned in Stronghold from 2004 to 2009, but escaped during Menton’s breakout.
-1: Oddly, despite being able to manipulate air and wind, Galeforce cannot fly.
-2: Galeforce’s powers actually involve control of pressure, not control of air and wind per se.
-10: Her Secret Identity is Andrea Thompson; she used to be an oceanographer.
