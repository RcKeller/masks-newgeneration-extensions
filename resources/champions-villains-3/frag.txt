Background/History: Lorna Culp discovered she had superpowers as a teenager, when she shoved another girl in an angry moment, and the other girl went sailing across the street head over heels. At first Lorna thought she was super-strong, but soon figured out her punches, shoves, and kicks carried uncanny destructive force. She hadn’t been in any lab accidents; her parents weren’t aliens; in fact, she couldn’t think of any even in her life to explain why she had superpowers. Lorna decided she must be a mutant. She already had a juvenile record for vandalism, shoplifting, and rowdy behavior. She had the Devil in her, her parents said.
Lorna didn’t know that in 1979, the master wizard Archimago abducted her mother as part of the Zodiac Working (see CU 65). The devil Malphas, a President in the descending Hierarchy, raped Lorna’s mother. The grimoires describe Malphas as appearing like a crow, and building
or destroying fortifications; he’s an officer in the Cohort of Avarice. Lorna’s mother spent most of her imprisonment in a daze, and remembered very little of what happened after the Fabulous Five rescued her. Lorna’s mother wasn’t preg- nant, so the heroes sent her to counseling for her trauma and didn’t think more of the matter. Two years later, Lorna’s mother married, and Lorna came a year after that.
Lorna decided to become a supervillain. She liked damaging and defacing other people’s prop- erty, and she wanted money. She didn’t have to end up a poor, tired woman living in a slum, like her mother. She could get filthy rich and have a lot of fun doing it.
Personality/Motivation: Frag wants to get rich as quickly as possible. She usually acts on her own, or with a small gang of mundane thugs, to rob a bank, jewelry store, or some other place with lots of easily transported valuables. Sometimes she organizes ad hoc teams of other villains for larger robberies. Less often, she works for other villains as part of a team, or as a hired demolitionist.
Lorna’s other great passion is property destruc- tion. She loves to leave a mess: even if she can break into a building by shattering a lock, she prefers to go through the wall. Her tendency to collapse buildings as a distraction to delay pursuit makes her loathed by several heroes she’s encoun- tered (not to mention city rescue services; on the other hand, a few unscrupulous members of the construction industry wish she were more active).
Her demonic heritage also gives Lorna a fierce temper. Normally she keeps it under control,
but the pain of an injury can provoke an insane, destructive rage in which she lashes out at every- thing around her. Frag’s rages always result in massive destruction of property.
Quote: “And the walls come tumblin’ down!”


Powers/Tactics: Frag can project powerfully destructive energy through her touch. She can release bursts of force to crush enemies or send them flying; or she can make an object crumble by stroking it. Frag can even set her destructive energies to tear a target apart at some later time: for example, she can set her Touch Of Destruc- tion on all the support pillars of a building so they crumble together an hour later. With greater effort, Lorna can radiate a blast of force, or send shockwaves along sturdy surfaces such as road- ways or walls.
When Frag goes berserk, she becomes stronger, faster, tougher, and almost tireless. Lorna thinks this is just part of her mutation.
Campaign Use: Frag has no clue about her real background. She thinks she’s just another supervil- lainess; she doesn’t realize she’s part of Archima- go’s dark legacy to the world. Frag may well serve a purpose she knows nothing about.
To make Frag a more powerful adversary, increase her Characteristics. Pehaps she can use her Infernal added powers at will, but is likely to go Berserk when she does so. Frag is not meant to be a very powerful opponent, though. To make her less formidable, scale back her Multipower to 52 points, remove her Shockwave slots, or remove her Infernal powers.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: As mentioned above, Frag is ready and willing to work with other “freelance” supervillains to commit jobs she can’t handle on her own. (On
the other hand, she has no desire to work for an organization like VIPER; she thinks “the man” will always take advantage of her, one way or another.) Some of the villains she’s worked with in the past (and parted on good terms with) include Holo- caust, the Brain Trust, Smoke and Mirrors, Merc- Force 1, Grenadier, and Stiletto.
After viewing Frag’s aura, the Demonologist knows she’s a product of the Zodiac Working, so he keeps a close eye on her. He’d love to find a way to take control of the Working for his own ends, and Frag just might be the key. Dark Seraph also knows what she is, and is interested in her for the same reason.
It’s possible that other artifacts and super- humans “left behind” by Archimago — such as Evil Eye (see page 104) — might be persuaded or coerced to join forces with Frag by his magics... or vice-versa.
Appearance: Lorna Culp is a young black woman standing 5’4” tall, with a slim but athletic build and close-cropped hair. As Frag, she wears a black leather jacket and thigh-length leather boots over scarlet tights. She also wears a high-tech visor and clips fake dreadlocks into her hair as a disguise. Her appearance changes when she goes Berserk: she grows several inches taller and becomes more muscular, ripping her tights; scales cover her body; her face warps into that of a bird with a hooked beak, while her hair stiffens and rises in a birdlike crest. Her nails also lengthen and thicken into short claws.
