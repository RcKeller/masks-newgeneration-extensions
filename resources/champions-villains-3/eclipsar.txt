ECLIPSAR
Background/History: Although she’d barely begun her career as an archaeologist, Lucia Esquivel had already become renowned for her skill (or, as her rivals put it, luck) at finding never before discov- ered Inca and Moche sites. Already there was talk of granting her tenure, even though she wasn’t
yet 30, and she felt her latest Andean find would clinch the deal. She didn’t know much about the long-lost Inca city yet, but that would come in time. Years of fieldwork lay ahead of her.
As she brushed away the dirt from the grid she was working in, her hands felt something solid. Working quickly, she uncovered a disk the size of a dinner platter. Must be an Inti, she thought, refer- ring to the Inca god of the sun who was usually represented as a face inside a sun disk. But as she uncovered more of it, she realized she was wrong. This wasn’t Inti. For one thing, the disk seemed
to be made of obsidian. For another, the face it bore was not the benevolent face of the sun god
— it looked malicious, cruel, and above all dark. It’s almost an... anti-Inti, she thought. Suddenly
a darkness flowed up and out of the disk. Before she could even scream, it engulfed her... and she disappeared along with the disk.
That was the last anyone ever saw of Lucia Esquivel. Eleven weeks later during the 2000 summer solstice, the being Eclipsar, a living thing of pure shadow and hatred, appeared in the city
of Lima. After blotting out the sun over most of South and Central America, she began killing every human being she could see. Only the timely intervention of La Brigada de Victoria, the Justice Squadron, and a small army of UNTIL agents kept her from turning northern South America into a wasteland. Defeated and weakened, she was captured and placed in a cell in the Guardhouse that was not only technologically and mystically shielded, but filled with bright light every second of the day so she couldn’t teleport away.
In early 2004, an escape attempt by the super-strong villain Obelisque caused a tempo- rary power outage in part of the Guardhouse.
In the less than two seconds between the loss of power and the activation of backup generators and batteries, Eclipsar vanished. She has not yet re-appeared, but the superheroes of Earth know it’s only a matter of time before she wreaks havoc once more....
Personality/Motivation: Lucia Esquivel was a gifted and compassionate woman of learning
until the day that an ancient Incan demon, a sort of “opposite” or arch-enemy of the sun god Inti, merged with her. Now, her past life almost entirely forgotten, she’s a ravening force of darkness
and destruction. Her overwhelming desire is to destroy the Sun and plunge the world into dark- ness. She can do this in either of two ways. First, she can somehow attack the Sun directly and snuff it out. Her powers aren’t normally strong enough to do this, but they might be at times of solstice, or on other days of great evil mystic significance. Second, she can “starve” the Sun to death by removing its source of mystic sustenance, human life-force. In short, she can slaughter every living human being, and thus destroy the Sun.
Quote: “I will make of the Sun a cinder, and upon the likes of you I will feast.”
Powers/Tactics: Eclipsar is an immensely powerful quasi-mystic being who wields a power known as the Darklight. The ultimate embodiment of shadow, darkness, and evil, the Darklight allows her to blast her enemies, confine them in bind- ings or spheres of pure force, protect herself, and travel instantaneously across planetary distances. It also infuses her body, making her very difficult to harm or affect in any way.
Eclipsar’s power comes with some corre- sponding weaknesses — to light, solar, and celestial attacks (not including Flashes, just attacks that do STUN and/or BODY). Normally Light attacks are “Uncommon,” but in this case she’s so obviously vulnerable to them that they become Common. (Solar and Celestial powers are also
an obvious weakness, but aren’t frequent enough to qualify as Common regardless.) Similarly, surrounding her with bright light prevents her from using her Teleportation (she cannot over- come this restriction using her own Darkness powers; she has to get out of the light naturally).

Eclipsar has little in the way of combat tactics; she simply shows up, begins destroying whatever she feels she must destroy, and reacts to attackers in a swift, brutal fashion. She doesn’t pull her punches or test her foes’ strengths with lesser- powered attacks; she opens the battle
with the most powerful or effective attack she can. If confronted by multiple foes, she tries to restrain as many as possible with Entangles before polishing off the remainder, then returns to the captured heroes to finish the job.
Campaign Use: Eclipsar is a terrifyingly powerful villainess, almost a force of nature more than a person, and should be used as such. If she’s not tough enough to take on your entire team of PCs, improve her until she is — increase her Damage Reduction, add attacks (or DCs to her existing attacks), and boost Characteristics until the PCs learn to treat her with the respect and fear she deserves. If she’s too powerful for your campaign as-is, start shaving points off Characteristics until she’s more reason- able.... but still dangerous.
Appearance: Eclipsar looks like her former self — a 5’8” tall, slender, attractive woman — made out of pure shadow. Her “body” is so dark that it’s usually not possible to see facial features unless she’s in profile or light strikes her from the right angle. She radi- ates malice and evil so strongly that even ordinary people can feel it.



ECLIPSAR FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Eclipsar if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Eclipsar is a supervillainess with extensive darkness powers. She’s one of the most powerful villains in the world; during her debut in 2000 she blotted out the sun over most of South and Central America.
K/R: Eclipsar was confined in the Guard- house from 2000 to 2004; she escaped during Obelisque’s breakout attempt and hasn’t been seen since.
-6: Eclipsar suffers intense pain when attacks with Light or Solar/Celestial powers, and may fly into a rage as a result.
-10: Prior to her transformation, Eclipsar was Lucia Esquivel, an archaeologist. At this point it’s uncertain whether there’s anything human left in her at all.
