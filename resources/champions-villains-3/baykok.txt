BAYKOK
Background/History: Baykok is a menacing creature from the Higher Lands, the portion of Faerie inhabited by the gods and demons of the Chippewa tribes. It has long plagued the Timas- jomi tribe. The Timasjomi swore centuries ago to oppose it in all ways and were blessed with the Dawn Fire Ritual, which creates warriors specifi- cally charged with battling Baykok and similar monsters. The current wielder of the Dawn Fire magic and weapons is Tomahawk of the Justice Squadron, who’s fought Baykok on multiple occasions.
Personality/Motivation: Baykok is a demon who feeds upon the hearts and souls of true warriors for sustenance, though it also enjoys killing other people for sport. It has a particular antipathy
for the Timasjomi tribe, which has opposed it
for countless centuries, but it happily feasts on warriors from other cultures whenever the oppor- tunity arises. The definition of a “true warrior” seems to involve both a love of martial matters in general as well as a desire to protect and defend others — thus, a generally peaceful superhero who only fights when he needs to and seeks peaceful resolutions to conflicts wouldn’t qualify, no matter how heroic he might be. On the other hand, any hero or villain who particularly enjoys fighting might, provided he has some desire to protect someone or something.
Quote: “Ssssss! I think your sssoul will be particu- larly tasssty, mortal. But please, fight me! I know you mussst.”
Powers/Tactics: This character sheet represents the sort of avatar that Baykok can project to
Earth to work his will; in his home dimension of Faerie he’s considerably more powerful. He fights primarily with his magical bow, which shoots fiery arrows, and a magic club. He can also change his shape, though he can’t assume the form of any “technological” object (meaning just about any man-made device more complex than a Neolithic stone chopper). His shapeshifting powers make it easy for him to surprise or ambush his foes, but once battle begins he’s a straightforward fighter.
Campaign Use: Baykok is an ideal foe for any character who, like Tomahawk, has some connec- tion to the American Indians or their culture. If there’s no such character in your game, you can change him into a similar but more appropriate figure — for example, a Southeast Asian version might have six arms, each wielding a distinct weapon.
To make Baykok a tougher foe for your PCs, increase his Characteristics until he’s at the right level to really challenge them. If he’s a bit too tough already, scale back his Combat Skill Levels and reduce his CON and DEX to about 23-25 each.
Appearance: Baykok is a skeletal American Indian warrior standing seven feet tall; he wears buck- skins and carries an oversized bow. His eyesockets glow with small red flames, and he has a long forked tongue like a serpent.

BAYKOK FACTS
