Background/History: Angela Charles comes from a family that never exactly embraced wholesome American values. Her great-grandfather was an outlaw in the Old West, her grandfather a boot- legger working for the Irish mob in Boston during Prohibition, and her father a con artist, burglar, and smuggler. He started to bring Angela along on his burglary jobs when she was only eight years old — a child can fit through windows too small for a grown man — and used her in his grifting schemes, too. It was an interesting education, and a lot more fun than school.
When Angela found out she was a mutant, with the power to control the air, her father knew they had it made. They didn’t have to bother scaling walls anymore; she could fly them both up to
the roof, where there were always fewer security systems to bypass. They could carry more loot. And if they had to make a quick getaway, it’s hard to beat being able to fly at hundreds of miles per hour.
Everything was going perfectly — until they walked into a police ambush. When they tried to get away, the police opened fire. Angela’s powers protected her, but she didn’t act quickly enough to get in front of her father, and he was hit several times. She rushed him to an underworld doctor, but it was too late. He died on the makeshift oper- ating table. Filled with cold fury, Angela flew to the precinct house and demolished it with torna- does and wind-blasts. Then she soared off into the night to begin her own criminal career.
Since then Zephyr’s become a well-known member of the supervillain community with a certain degree of quirky popularity due to her good looks. More importantly to her, as the
years have passed not only has her control of air and wind strengthened, but to her surprise she’s developed a small amount of control over two
of the other classical elements: earth and fire. She’s worked hard to improve those abilities and develop new ones, though they’ve yet to come close to matching her air powers. She figures it’s only a matter of time before she manifests a water power as well. She’s done her best to keep these new abilities secret; her new powers are not public knowledge.
Personality/Motivation: Zephyr’s never known a normal existence; she’s been a criminal all her life. The idea of earning a living in the usual way, by getting a job and working in an office from eight to five, makes absolutely no sense to her — why work when you can take what you want? Crime comes as naturally to her as ordinary work does to most people.
Her absolute contempt and hatred for cops, superheroes, and anyone else in authority only makes matters worse. Anytime she gets to outwit, evade, or beat up policemen, she takes it, laughing the whole time. Though she’d never kill any of them (that causes a lot more trouble than it’s worth), she’ll gladly hurt them, put them in embarrassing positions, or interfere with their work. She won’t obey or cooperate with any law enforcement officer unless forced to.
Quote: “You’d have better luck trying to chain a tornado than capture me!”
Powers/Tactics: Zephyr is a mutant with the ability to interact with her environment and manipulate it. At present, her abilities mostly involve the control of air and wind, though she has a few fire and earth powers and is likely to develop more. I theory her powers could extend to affecting the ground, plants, water, and just about any other natural substance or phenomenon.
Zephyr has learned how to alter the flow of air in her immediate vicinity to achieve many different effects. She can fly at over 500 miles per hour, create mini-tornadoes and more focused wind-blasts, suck all the air out of someone’s lungs, or use the wind to pick up and move objects. In combat, she prefers to use her Wind Blast or Wind Gust, though if she runs into END use problems she’ll switch to attacks that aren’t so strenuous. If she knows an opponent can take it, she may pick him up with her Telekinesis, carry him along at a high rate of speed with her Flight, and then let him go so he slams into something hard.

Campaign Use: Zephyr makes a good addition to many teams of villains; her powers combine versatility with a good offensive “punch.”
If Zephyr needs to be more powerful to stand up to your PCs, expand her power over fire, earth, and other aspects of the environment. In theory, she could eventually become incredibly powerful — as powerful as Firewing or Gravitar in terms of raw points, and with a much more flexible suite of powers than either of them. If she’s already too strong, rein in her Wind Attacks Multipower — reduce the Active Points in each by about 25-33%.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Zephyr’s happy to work with other villains who share her general attitude about the use of lethal force, particularly if they also share her love of beating up cops and superheroes. She’s less likely to team up with violent or murderous criminals, but has done so in the past and undoubtedly will again. Many of her team-ups have been with other women (such as Photon and Shrinker) or villains who have similar powers (like Stormfront).
Kinematik has spoken to Zephyr about joining his pro-mutant crusade, but she has no real polit- ical/social conscience and could care less about his “message.” If she keeps ignoring him eventually he’ll label her a “race traitor” and put her on his list of enemies.
Appearance: Zephyr is a woman of remarkable beauty; she could easily become a model, or an actress, if she wanted to. Her long platinum blonde hair, blue eyes, flawless skin, and attractive figure aren’t soon forgotten by those who see her. As Zephyr, she wears a sky-blue costume with the alchemical symbol for air on it dark blue. She doesn’t wear a mask.

ZEPHYR FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Zephyr if they succeed with an appro- priate Skill Roll:
N/R: Zephyr is a supervillainess with powers of air and wind control. She has a deep-seated hatred for cops, guards, superheroes, public officials, and other authority figures.
K/R: Her real name is Angela Charles; her father (and many relatives before him) was a criminal who taught her the “family trade” before her mutant powers emerged. He was killed by the police during a botched robbery.
-8: In addition to her air powers, Zephyr also has some minor control over fire and earth, too.
