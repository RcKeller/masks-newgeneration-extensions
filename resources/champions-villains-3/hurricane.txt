Background/History: Phillip Beaudoin was born in 1978. His father was Philip Beaudoin, the supervillain Flashover during the Seventies and Eighties. In 1994 his sister Danielle, eager to avenge their father’s many defeats at the hands of the Justice Squadron, had the arch-geneticist Teleios transform her into a new Flashover.
When Danielle “turned soft” and became a superhero and member of the very team she had once sought to destroy, Phillip was disgusted.
He decided that if she wasn’t going to get the job done, it was up to him. He approached Teleios
in turn... and the master villain, amused, agreed to grant him powers. But rather than give him the ability to control fire, Teleios chose to make him a manipulator of air and wind. Taking the name Hurricane, Phillip has also taken up his sister’s discarded goal of getting revenge against the Justice Squadron... including the traitorous Flashover. When not involved in some scheme to destroy them, he usually works as a mercenary supervillain for well-heeled employers.
Personality/Motivation: Hurricane has a classic supervillainous personality. He’s driven by two things: first, a deep-rooted desire for revenge
for the “wrongs” done to his father and family; second, greed with a touch of megalomania. He’s not the sort of villain who wants to conquer the world, but he has no qualms about causing all sorts of destruction to show off his power and humble his enemies.
Quote: “Fool! You don’t have a chance against someone who can control the very air you breathe!”
Powers/Tactics: Hurricane is an immensely powerful air and wind manipulator (to a certain extent his powers also involve cold, through wind chill and the like). His abilities aren’t as precise or sophisticated as those of some other superhumans (such as Zephyr), but they make up for it with sheer power. His name comes from his signature attack, a swirling field of wind 30m in radius that surrounds him and hurts anyone who enters it, smashing them with gale-force winds and then flinging them off in some random direction. He can also fire directed blasts of wind in various sizes and strengths, use the wind to pick up
(and even crush) objects, and block attacks with shields of air. On the downside, despite the fact that he can withstand ordinary low temperatures, his mutated metabolism is vulnerable to ice and cold attacks (a weakness deliberately engineered by Teleios in case he needed a way to control his creation).
Hurricane has little sense of tactics — he charges right in and begins attacking the most powerful foe he can find as a way of showing off his power. He usually focuses on one target until that target’s down, then moves on to another.

He’s not deliberately murderous, but he doesn’t care if someone (be it a hero or innocent bystanders) gets seriously hurt or killed because of the way he uses his powers.
Campaign Use: Hurricane is intended as a foe who, in the right circumstances, can take on a whole team like the Justice Squadron and battle them to a standstill (at least for a while). If he’s not tough enough to fulfill that role in your campaign, beef him up until he is; among other things, consider adding some Damage Reduction so he loses STUN more slowly. If he’s already too tough, scale down his Characteristics some, and perhaps reduce the DCs of his attacks. By reducing his END you can restrict how often he can use a lot of abilities at full power.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Teleios keeps track of Hurricane just like he does with most of his other creations. It’s possible (in fact, it’s virtu- ally certain) he even built in some genetic-level loyalty to himself that he can trigger at any time, making Hurricane his puppet.
Appearance: Hurricane is a 5’9” tall white man with an average build and long brown hair falling to his shoulders. He wears a red and blue jump- suit, obviously armored and with padding to exag- gerate his physique, including oversized shoulder pads.
