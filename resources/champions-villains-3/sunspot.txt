Background/History: Hamdah “Ham” Sabeti was a second-generation immigrant to the United States from the Middle East. His parents were the typical poor, struggling newcomers to the country who scrimped and saved so their son could go to college — where he did so well in his studies of science that he got a job with NASA!
After several years of working diligently on various projects, Sabeti became one of the team leaders on a planned manned mission to visit
the Sun and study it close-up. In fact, he became so important to the project, and his knowledge
of the subject so valuable, that NASA decided to send him along on the mission. He trained hard to get himself to something approaching astronaut standards of fitness and knowledge.
As the mission module approached the Sun, everything was going well and the team was gathering lots of data. Suddenly the sensors began to spike and the readings became odd. Then without warning a massive solar flare engulfed the capsule! Back on Earth NASA’s radios and sensors went dead; everyone assumed the module and all personnel aboard had been burned to cinders.
They learned they were wrong a few days later when Sabeti returned to Earth... under his own power. He was no longer the calm, insightful, humorous man his colleagues had known and admired. Somehow the flare had infused him with solar energy, and in the process burned away most of his humanity as well. Now he called himself Sunspot, and the world would learn to fear his name!

Personality/Motivation: The solar flare that gave Sunspot his energy powers changed his person- ality as well. Now he seems to consider humans
as some sort of “infestation” of planet Earth that needs to be “cured” — if not by his fires, then another way, but cleansed all the same. He can tolerate working with other humans (supervil- lains) to achieve short-term goals along the path to his final objective, but ultimately he wants them “removed” too.
In his more grandiose, less lucid moments Sunspot sometimes thinks of himself as the embodiment of some ancient sun-god. A few deranged individuals have actually begun to worship him that way, though he doesn’t acknowl- edge them.
Quote: “My sunfires will cleanse you from this world.”
Powers/Tactics: Exposure to a strange solar flare somehow transformed Sunspot’s body so that it acts like a sort of “living solar battery.” Exposure to the light of a sun (whether Earth’s, or any other star within about 100 million miles of him) fills his body with energy that he can release to fly,
to protect himself, or to attack his enemies with devastating bolts of “sunfire.” But when there’s
no direct sunlight — at night, or if he’s in a room with no access to sunlight, for example — he can quickly run out of power if he’s not careful. (In game terms, the REC of his Endurance Reserve depends on exposure to sunlight. On a particu- larly overcast day, you might halve the REC, and it hasn’t yet been determined if he can use his REC when bathed in artificial light designed to simulate pure sunlight. At your option, when Sunspot’s Endurance Reserve runs out of END, he can fuel his powers with his personal END, but if so all his powers automatically cost twice as much END.)
Sunspot prefers to fight aggressively, using his powers in a spectacular, attention-grabbing manner. He often likes to open battle with a Sunfire Flare followed by a Presence Attack.
Campaign Use: The big question surrounding Sunspot concerns the nature of the solar flare that gave him his powers. Was it natural... or artifi- cial? If the latter, who or what caused it, and most importantly why? Why did it give him powers but kill everyone else on the mission module? Does his origin relate in any way to the origins of Stareye (see Merc-Force 1 in CV2) or Photon (see page 226)? Is he perhaps connected to Eclipsar, a being empowered by the sun to somehow oppose hre anti-sun powers and goals?
To make Sunspot a more powerful opponent, increase the amount of END in his Endurance Reserve so he can keep fighting longer even after he’s cut off from the Sun’s light. You may also want to give him more powers, or increase the strength of his attacks, so that he can take on entire teams of heroes by himself (after all, he doesn’t like working with other villains). To weaken him, reduce his Reserve’s END.


SUNSPOT FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Sunspot if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Sunspot is a supervillain with “solar fire” powers that allow him to project powerful energy blasts, blind his foes with flashes of bright light, and even fly at the speed of light in space.
K/R: His real name is Hamdah “Ham” Sabeti; he used to be a NASA scientist.
-1: Sunfire wants to “cleanse” the Earth of its human “infestation.”
-4: At times Sunfire seems to think
of himself as the incarnation of some ancient sun-god.
-8: Darkness- based attacks are particularly effective against Sunspot.

Appearance: Sunspot is an Arabic man, 5’8” tall with a moderately
athletic build. His costume is mostly gold, but with boots and gloves formed
from a “black energy spot” pattern. He’s got a “bandolier” of the same black energy spots
running from his left waist to right shoulder, getting broader as it rises until it fills the whole
shoulder. His mask covers his entire face.
