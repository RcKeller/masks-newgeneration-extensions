Background/History: Born to an impoverished family living in a poor neighborhood, Tara Lemick never felt neglected or deprived. Her parents didn’t have much money, but they had lots of love to shower on her. Thriving in such a supportive environment, Tara did excellently in school. Even after she was old enough to go to work and help support the family, she continued to get straight As.
Tara’s hard work won her a full scholarship to a prestigious university, where she majored in Elec- tronic Engineering. Her specialty was force fields, and in her senior year she invented a revolu- tionary new form of force field technology. At first she considered selling it and making a fortune, but her conscience nagged at her. How would that help people? She was lucky — she had enough smarts and support to get into college and make something of herself. Too many people never had that kind of opportunity.

Determined to make a difference, Tara used her technology to build a skintight “battlesuit” that would allow her to fly and project bolts of energy. Thus armed, she decided the best thing she could do for others was to emulate Robin Hood: rob from the rich, give to the poor. And that’s what she’s been doing ever since. Beautiful, kindhearted, popular, and careful in her choice of robbery targets, she’s not only distributed millions of stolen dollars to America’s poor, but managed to do it while maintaining a popularity rating as high, or higher, than most superheroes’. She’s dated celebrities (including rock star Jimmy Caxton), appeared on magazine covers, made surprise visits to talk shows, been spoken of positively by some liberal politicians, and is the subject of dozens of fan websites devoted to tracking her every activity and praising everything she does.
Personality/Motivation: Lady Blue genuinely cares about the poor and disadvantaged, not only in America but elsewhere. Helping them is her primary motivation for committing property crimes. But truth to tell, she also gets a big kick out of it — not just the helping people part, but the action, the excitement, the thrills. Even the fights against superheroes are fun (though some- times painful), and she takes care not to inflict any serious harm with her force blasts. She boasts of having never hurt an innocent person in any of her crimes, and while that’s not entirely true, it’s so close to true that the public believes her. That fact, and some of the best criminal defense attorneys available, have kept her out of prison so far.
Quote: “If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Stop being part of the problem and leave me alone, OK?”
Powers/Tactics: Lady Blue’s powers derive from her battlesuit, which incorporates a unique form of force field technology she invented. The suit’s field protects her, allows her to fire different types of force blasts, and can even “thrust” against the Earth’s magnetic field to let her fly. However, expo- sure to intense magnetic fields, or magnetic blasts like those Lodestone (see page 190) generates, cause painful short circuits in the suit.
Lady Blue loves thrills and excitement, but she prefers not to fight too much — someone might get hurt. She’ll fight to get away, but she won’t linger over the battle any longer than she has to. Unless she knows her opponent can take it, she’ll start with lower-powered force blasts before unleashing her battlesuit’s full offensive capabilities.
Campaign Use: Lady Blue should present an interesting moral dilemma for most superheroes. On the one hand, her actions are unquestion-
ably criminal. She steals, and in some cases she endangers lives. On the other hand, her motives are entirely unselfish. She gives away all the money she doesn’t need to maintain her battlesuit, and has genuinely helped dozens of people to better themselves. Putting her in jail might cause more harm than good. And of course, the possibility of romance with a sympathetic male PC definitely exists....
If Lady Blue isn’t strong enough to hold her own in your campaign, increase the size of her Multipower reserve, and her slots to match. You could also give her more slots — other force
blast configurations, or even different powers
like Entangle, Telekinesis, or Deflection. If she’s already too powerful, reduce her Multipower to a 50 Active Point reserve, trim 2-5 points off each of her defenses (and remove her Damage Negation), and reduce her Flight to 30m.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Lady Blue usually works alone, but she sometimes teams up with villains who have reasonably similar motives. She’s worked with GRAB before, and is good friends with Bluejay. She doesn’t like Cheshire Cat at all, though; he comes on too strong for her taste.
Lady Blue also maintains informal contact via e-mail with other supervillains who are inventors or are known for their technological acumen, such as Brainchild, Wayland Talos, and Utility. They exchange information and bounce ideas off one another.
Appearance: Lady Blue’s costume is a battlesuit is a pleasing blend of light blue and green, with a half-face mask that let her long blonde hair flow free. When her powers are active, a gold glow surrounds her.
