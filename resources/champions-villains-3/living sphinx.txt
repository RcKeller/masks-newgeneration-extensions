Background/History: The Living Sphinx is a unique mystical creature who lives primarily in the extradimensional world of Ma’at, the part
of Faerie that’s home to the ancient Egyptian pantheon. A terrifying monster, the Living Sphinx periodically visits Earth to spread fear, chaos, and destruction, which he loves. He’s terrorized Egypt periodically over centuries, but he reappears much more frequently now — Earth’s become a buffet of delicacies since 1938.
Personality/Motivation: The Living Sphinx’s sole overriding desire is the kill. The death of any living being in his presence, whether he’s the killer or not, provides him with spiritual sustenance
and intense physical sensations of pleasure — he psychically “tastes” the target’s soul as it passes from this plane. However, the sensations are much stronger if the deceased is the bearer of strong mystical powers, so the Living Sphinx makes a particular point of pursuing and killing magical beings and masters of the Arts Arcane.
Quote: “Sweet your soul will taste.”

Powers/Tactics: A mighty fighter, with incred- ible speed, strength, resilience, and magically- enhanced claws that can rend even the bodies
of astral or otherwise insubstantial beings, the Living Sphinx is a terrifying opponent, especially for mystics or on those rare occasions when he “teams up” with villains. He cannot be destroyed on Earth’s plane — destruction of his mortal form merely causes it to be reborn in Ma’at, though it takes several years for his mystical energies to coalesce again. He retains his full memories from his “previous life,” and will no doubt attempt to take revenge on whoever defeated him. He can
be physically and permanently destroyed in Ma’at itself, though on his home plane he’s even more powerful.
Campaign Use: The Living Sphinx is a killing machine with a particular taste for magical victims. He makes a great straightforward adver- sary for any mystic PC. As a unique and magical “beast” he could be the object of an adventure — to fulfill some task or quest, the PCs have to fetch one of his claws as an ingredient for a powerful spell, or win some other device, boon, or informa- tion by challenging him to a game of riddles.
To make the Living Sphinx tougher, increase his Damage Reduction or keep boosting his Char- acteristics until he’s powerful enough to frighten the bejesus out of your PCs. You could also give him a small Variable Power Pool for magic spells he can cast. To weaken him, reduce his Charac- teristics (especially SPD), get rid of his Damage Reduction, and/or reduce the DCs in his HKAs.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: The Living Sphinx is a solitary being not given to working
with others. However, he willingly follows the orders of Anubis (page 13), whom he
regards as a divine messenger.
Appearance: The Living Sphinx is a horrifying creature, as much beast as man. His chest and lower body is vaguely catlike, complete with short black fur, clawed feet, and a long tail. Unlike his mythical namesake, however, the Living Sphinx stands
upright... and, at 6’6” tall, towers over most people. His neck, shoulders, and arms are humanoid, though he has long, thick, wickedly sharp claws in place of fingernails. Its head and face are gener- ally human, but twisted into bestial anger, with fiery golden eyes and thick reddish-brown hair that falls like a mane around his shoulders and back. His voice is deep, disturbing, and obviously
non-human.
