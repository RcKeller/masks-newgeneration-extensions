Background/History: Frank Winston was a cabbie in Millennium City. He’d seen it all — drunks
and druggies, the destruction of Detroit, the rebuilding, superbattles, you name it — and survived. He was a tough guy; nothing fazed him.
One night he picked up a guy in a long, black cloak. He couldn’t really make out the guy’s face, but so what? His money would spend as good as any other fare’s. He drove the guy out of the city, into the country, and finally along a twisting, winding dirt road leading deep into a dark forest. The road came to a large, eerie-looking mansion perched atop a cliff over a body of water Frank didn’t recognize.
“I suppose you wish to be paid now,” his passenger said.
“Yeah, I gotta get back to the city, pal. My shift ends soon.”
“Very well. But tonight you shall be paid in a coin of a different color.” The man flashed a weird- looking gold coin in front of Frank’s eyes. Instantly mesmerized, he couldn’t do anything but stare at the coin.
“Come,” the man said, getting out of the cab. Frank couldn’t help but follow. They walked into the house, down some stone stairs, and into the basement. Frank could see tables full of glassware, a shelf full of thick, old books, and a pentagram on the floor. The man gestured, and Frank went over and lay down in the pentagram, spread-eagled.
“I have need of a servant to perform... errands for me,” the man said, in a voice that now had a hiss to it. “You shall do perfectly for my purposes; no one would miss a common simpleton such as yourself.”
With that, the man performed an arcane ritual. Frank screamed and begged for mercy as his body painfully began to change form. They were the last words he would ever utter. A little while later, Frank Winston was gone, and in his place stood the Leech, an unquestioning servant of evil.
Personality/Motivation: Leech’s personality is that of a servile predator. He hunts and captures people for his master (and in fact is prone to obeying anyone who exerts mystical Mind Control over him). Beyond basic thoughts of food, survival, and the like, he doesn’t have much intelligence, though he does display a devilish cunning.
Memories of what he once was have given Leech a burning hatred of beauty, especially beau- tiful people. Even if he’s not hungry, he may attack an attractive person just to use Life Leeching on them and make them a little weaker and uglier for a while.
Quote: None. Leech is mute; at most he can make gibbering, burbling sounds of acquiescence or rage.

Powers/Tactics: Leech is a hand-to-hand combatant; he has no ranged powers (though his ability to stretch his body and limbs sometimes makes for a good Surprise Move). Usually he tries to Grab his victim, then apply Leeching; the Grab effect from his Strangle maneuver is sufficient for him to start Draining his victim. He often makes Multiple Attacks with two or more slots (note that all the slots are Variable), or by combining Stran- gling/Strangle with Leeching. He targets beautiful opponents first in most cases.
Leech prefers to attack from ambush at all possible. He either lurks near the water’s edge and then leaps onto his prey (strangling it as he drags it back into the water), or he uses his Adaptive Camouflage to get close enough to unwary people to Grab them. He usually spends his days in deep water or the sewers; he loathes sunlight.
Campaign Use: Typically superheroes are likely to encounter Leech as he goes on errands for his master, but that’s not a full-time job. In his “spare time,” he can do other things, like hunt for food (people) or join/be coerced into working with other supervillains.
The major story hook connected with Leech is: who transformed him and now uses him as a servant? Was it a member of the Circle Of The Scarlet Moon? A Morbane of DEMON? The Black Paladin or Dark Seraph? Or someone else alto- gether? Is the mansion where he was transformed the same as the Delacroix Mansion (see Shades Of Black), or some other place?
To make Leech more powerful, consider adding some Damage Reduction, or increase
the reserve on his Multipower. To make him less powerful, reduce his STR to 30, his SPD to 4, and get rid of two or three of his Leeching powers.
Appearance: The Leech is a hideous mockery of humanity, a merging of leech and man. His body is a mottled grey-brown, with other putrid colors showing through here and there. His mouth has been subsumed into a mass of mucousy flesh, and where he once had hands and feet, he now has suckers surrounded by a fringe of cilia. His eyes are dark red and glare malevolently at almost everything.
