Background/History: Mother Gothel is one of the most notorious villains in the world, yet hardly anyone knows her name. Most people also think she’s fictional... but the Brothers Grimm collected a true story. Mother Gothel is the witch from “Hansel and Gretel” and she’s back, as hungry as ever for a sweet, satisfying meal of roast children.
Personality/Motivation: A fairy-tale monster like Mother Gothel exists to cause evil for its own sake. A folklore scholar might say she represents child- hood anxiety about abusive parents, or serves as
a cautionary tale about the dangers of strangers. Mother Gothel would cackle and say what a clever young fellow the folklorist was. Then she’d split his skull and feast on his brains.
Mother Gothel isn’t just a predator, though. Like other fairy tale hags, she follows a peculiar code of honor. She must give brave and selfless people a chance to defeat her. Thus, if she’s much more powerful than her captive, she cages him
to “fatten him up” instead of killing him at once. For all her cunning, the pure of heart can fool her with ease. (This accounts for her Unluck as well.) If someone overpowers her but spares her life, she grants them a boon. For instance, she might give the noble hero a magic item, the knowledge he needs to fulfill a quest, or a blessing on his first- born child. Selfish and wicked people — grown- ups or children — find Mother Gothel turning the tables on them, with her great roasting-pan already greased.
Quote: “What a tough and lean young man you are, Kinetik. A little tenderizing, I think, then an oil and garlic rub — after you’re butchered!”
Powers/Tactics: Mother Gothel is impossibly strong, quick, and tough for a little old lady. She can produce a variety of domestic items from her pockets and use them for magically-potent attacks. For instance, she can pull out a meat cleaver that cuts concrete, or trap someone in a tangle of yarn. Sweets and spices are her specialty, including magical cookies, candy, or gingerbread that puts people to sleep.
As a fairy tale witch, Mother Gothel has almost unlimited power to bless and curse. She can
grant (or impose) almost any physical change, including the creation of magic items. She often delivers blessings by feeding the recipient candy or gingerbread. Changes to a character’s destiny can be represented as a wide range of Complications. For instance, the Sleeping Beauty Curse (“When she is grown, she will prick her finger on a spindle and die”) can be a Physical Complication (worth zero points, since it only affects a character once). The variable Trigger lets her enchantments take effect in the future. Don’t sweat the details of the rules unless Mother Gothel attempts a Transform with an immediate combat effect, such as turning a character into a frog — this is a “plot device” power, more or less.

Children, Mother Gothel’s favored prey, are also her greatest weakness. Good children do double STUN damage against Mother Gothel, and her DCV is halved against them. This weakness
is entirely mystical, and PCs cannot do “clever” things to exploit it. For instance, a PC would not gain the half DCV and double STUN effect by having a child wrap his hand around the hero’s gun, while the hero actually aimed and fired.
Mother Gothel prefers to set up a Base designed to attract children. She keeps up with the times: instead of a gingerbread house, she might create a toy store or video arcade. She always keeps sweets around, though. Her Base always includes a dungeon-like kitchen, with cages for children... or larger prey.
Campaign Use: You can use Mother Gothel as
an encounter in Faerie, or bring her to Earth to boggle the characters’ minds when they realize those old nursery tales were true. Mother Gothel also serves as a model for other ogre-witches such as Baba Yaga or the hags from Norse and Anglo- Saxon mythology. These hags do not always act as pure villains: in Russian fairy tales, for instance, Baba Yaga is sometimes a “reluctant helper” whom the hero must overcome to gain her aid. As presented here, Mother Gothel can borrow roles from her weird sisters.
To make Mother Gothel a greater threat, increase her STR: Norse hags sometimes dropped mountains and islands from their aprons. She could also have a wider range of magic, or a flying broomstick. To make her less powerful, scale back her Multipower to 52 Active Points.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Mother Gothel may have some connection to Brangomar, the Shadow Queen (see CV1). Both are fairy tale- style villains. For example, perhaps Mother Gothel comes from the Shadow Realm that Brangomar rules, and thus is one of her “subjects” (or at the very least an agent of hers). On the other hand, they may simply come from the same “neighbor- hood” but have nothing else in common.
Appearance: Mother Gothel stands just under five feet tall. She has white hair, either flyaway
or pulled in a bun, an incredibly wrinkled face, shrewd black eyes, and a cackle that can break glass. She wears dowdy old clothes and a gingham apron with lots of pockets.
