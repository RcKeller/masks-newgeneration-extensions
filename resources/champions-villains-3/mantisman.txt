Background/History: Manfred Tisdale was a small, scrawny child who was constantly picked on by other children. But what he lacked in physical abilities he gained in mental, for he was a genius fascinated by the world around him. Rejected
by his peers, he retreated inward and became absorbed in his hobbies, primarily tinkering with electronics and collecting insects and rocks.
As he grew older, Manfred decided to apply his brainpower to the problem of dealing with the bullies and other tormentors he faced every day in school. He became skilled at practical jokes, particularly ones that involved stinging insects
or other “pets” he collected. He also decided that staying small and scrawny was too foolish a thing for someone as smart as him to do, so he began taking martial arts lessons.
His plan was working well until the day Brad Saunders picked on him one too many times and he used his new martial arts skills to fight back. He beat Saunders good... but Brad’s dad was the president of the local bank that held the mortgage on Manfred’s family’s house. A petty, vindictive little man, Mr. Saunders took revenge for his son’s beating by applying constant financial pressure to the Tisdales. Shortly after Manfred finished high school, his family had to declare bankruptcy and move into a much smaller, dingier house.
That was the last straw for Manfred. He real- ized the world was set up to let the bullies win and to keep people like him from fighting back. Well, if he wasn’t going to be allowed to succeed within “the system,” he’d succeed outside it! Combining his electronics skills with his love of entomology he built himself a suit of light powered armor and some other gadgets and became the costumed criminal MantisMan.
Personality/Motivation: MantisMan was driven to crime by what he perceives as society’s unfairness and rejection. Although at heart he’s not a particu- larly bad person compared to most supercriminals (for example, he goes to great lengths not to kill his foes), he’s so bitter about the way he and his family were treated that it’s highly unlikely he’ll ever return to the straight and narrow. (Besides, he has to secretly admit he enjoys the thrill of being a costumed criminal... not to mention making lots of money.)
MantisMan still has the same geekish fasci- nation with his hobbies that he did as a kid.
He particularly enjoys studying and collecting insects and often plans his crimes around them. For example, he might make a point of stealing a rare antique brooch in the shape of a dragonfly, or use a swarm of bees to clear out a bank so he can rob it. He’d love to invent a device that lets him summon and control insects, but so far that remains beyond his abilities. He has a bad habit of making insect-related jokes and puns.
Quote: “C’mon, Sapphire, no need to be so waspish. Don’t let it bug you that you can’t stop me!”
Powers/Tactics:
MantisMan wears a
suit of light powered
armor designed with an “insectile” aesthetic that gives him various insect-related powers. It lets him fly, leap great distances, and even stick to walls like a bug. Its weapons include “cocoon projectors” to immobi- lize his foes, “sting darts” coated with knockout poison, and
larger, deadlier darts (which
he only uses on objects and enemies he knows can take it, like Ironclad). But he’s not totally dependent on his gear; he’s studied Praying Mantis
Kung Fu for years.
In combat, MantisMan
prefers to keep moving;
he uses his Flight,
Leaping, and Clinging
to move around the battlefield constantly (i.e., he almost always makes a Half Move before attacking, usually to get behind cover or put some distance between himself and his target). He favors his Cocoon Paste most of the time; he’s found it’s easier and safer to immobilize his foes and get away than to stand and fight.
Campaign Use: MantisMan is a potentially redeemable villain, but it will take a lot of work on the PCs’ part to make him realize the world’s not the totally unfair place he thinks it is.
To make MantisMan tougher, increase his Armor to 20 PD/20 ED and his SPD to 5; you could also give him some more weapons (perhaps even “stings” that are Blasts of some sort). To weaken him get rid of his Martial Arts, making him entirely dependent on his gadgets.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Although he doesn’t know it, MantisMan is the target of Hornet’s anger. Hornet thinks (incorrectly) that MantisMan basically “copied” his (Hornet’s) powers when designing the MantisMan armor, and he intends to teach MantisMan some respect in the form of a serious beating as soon as he gets the chance.
MantisMan has admired Lady Blue’s “charity work” for many years, and has even considered offering her his assistance with her “crusade.” He’d love to help people who, like himself and his family, have been victimized by “the system.” At the very least he’d enjoy meeting her.
Appearance: MantisMan is a white male, 5’10” tall with an average build. His “costume” is a suit of green light powered armor with an “insect” motif: the eyes on the helmet are large, round, and slightly bulbous; the wings emerging from the wingpack on his back look like those of a dragonfly; there are tiny spines running down the sides of his gauntlets like those on the arms of a praying mantis; and so on.
