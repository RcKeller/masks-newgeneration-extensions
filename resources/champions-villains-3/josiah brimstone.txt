Collin, now calling himself “Josiah Brim- stone” as a sort of ironic joke and way to keep
his true identity and name a secret, traveled the world looking for the key with which to unlock the secrets that would enable him to regain his soul. He practiced meditation with sadhus in India, absorbing their holy wisdom and learning ways to control the demon within. He studied with Chinese and Japanese masters of the occult, practicing both martial arts and spellcraft with them. Hidden druidic circles in the British Isles, ancient cults in Russia, Middle Eastern fakirs
and dervishes, Haida Indian shamans in British Columbia, and many others taught the quiet, somber man who possessed such great power
but carried such a terrible burden. None of them could give him the key he sought — but with each mystic and magus he studied under, his already considerable power and knowledge grew even more. But he’s never learned enough to storm the gates of Hell and regain by force what was taken from him so long ago.
In time Brimstone made his way back to the United States. Since then he’s often found himself caught up in adventures. Sometimes he’s on the side of the angels, helping some hapless person with a mystic problem... though often as not his “help” is a double-edged sword. At other times
his demon-born selfishness and anger make him a threat to the peace and safety of innocent folk instead of a hero or helper. His burden is a terrible one, and he longs for the day he can set it aside forever... even if doing so costs him his arcane powers.
Personality/Motivation: Josiah Brimstone was once a cynical, jaded young man: a snob, a dilet- tante, an uncaring fool. Some of that changed when Belial replaced his soul with that of a demon, but for the most part things just got worse. Having a demon’s soul inside him has made him selfish, arrogant, snide, sarcastic, insultingly judg- mental, and annoyingly cryptic. Worst of all, he’s prone to completely losing his temper in stressful situations or when exposed to holy magics — and when that happens, sometimes the demonsoul frees itself and takes over his body.
Brimstone often tries to do what he thinks
is the “right thing,” on the theory that this will weaken the demonsoul. But between his negative personality traits and his Unluck he usually just makes things worse. Many heroes have concluded that turning down his offers of “help” is easier than working with him... which of course only angers him. And then there are the times the demonsoul influences his personality enough to make him
act like a full-blown supervillain. (In game terms, the GM should roll his Sometimes The Demonsoul Takes Over Psychological Complication periodi- cally; if the roll fails, Brimstone becomes thor- oughly, unhesitatingly evil for a while.)
JOSIAH BRIMSTONE
Background/History: It was a long, long time
ago in a strange, distant land: New York City, 1972. Out of boredom and rebelliousness, Collin Kildare, a college student and the wealthy son of even wealthier parents, turned to the occult. On Walpurgisnacht he worked his greatest magic ever: a conjuration to call forth a demon from the Nether Realms.
It worked... but not the way he intended. Unbe- knownst to anyone, even himself, Collin possessed a profound, innate talent for magic surpassing even that of most of the puissant mystics on Earth. What responded to his call was not just any demon — some lesser soldier or camp-follower of the armies of the infernal — but Belial, Duke of Hell and one of the most powerful beings in the Descending Hierarchy.
Belial gasped when he saw the power in young Collin — and then laughed with malefic glee when he realized the boy didn’t know how to use it yet and had left himself vulnerable. He decided to do something about this impudent fool now, before he came into his power enough to pose a threat to Belial or his masters... and to have a bit of fun in the process. He grabbed the screaming Collin and tore from him his very soul. And then he worked a summoning himself, calling one of his minions to him: a demon of vast and terrible power, but still beholden to the Duke Belial shoulder-and- hip. He gave young Collin’s soul to this demon as
a plaything... but then removed the demon’s own soul and thrust it into Collin’s body!
Collin awoke the next morning thinking he’d had way too much to drink. Then he saw the smeared pentagram drawn on the floor in red paint, and his memory came flooding back. He could feel the demon’s soul within him, flut- tering against his flesh like a butterfly trapped in
a man’s hand. Terrified, he fled from college and his former life, hoping to find some way to reverse what had happened and regain his own soul.
But that proved far harder than he’d thought. The first few months and years were painful ones, as he stumbled through the Mystic World looking for answers to a question he could barely formu- late. Even worse, he soon discovered that the demonsoul within him could break free, trans- forming his body into diabolic form so it could wreak great harm and evil. In time he developed
a rigid self-control, the better to keep the demon chained within him, but not even his iron will was always enough: the very demonsoul within him corrupted him, making him prone to great rage, and during those times when his passions over- came his will the demon was most likely to break free for a time until his own personalty re-asserted itself.

Josiah desperately wants to get his own soul back. He believes the demon Belial gave it to,
or perhaps Belial himself, still has it. But even if that’s true, that doesn’t mean he can easily get it back. He’s tried storming the gates of Hell twice to take it by force, only to be repulsed each time — because he lost it through his own folly, he has to find a way to get it back through his own maturity, responsibility, and good deeds, he can’t just snatch it back. But he would be willing to risk much to regain it.
Quotes:
1. “Like the man said, there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Believe me.”
2. “If there’s one thing I know about, it’s fighting your inner demons.”
Powers/Tactics: Josiah Brimstone is a supermage of great might, able to command the powers of Thaumaturgy with nothing more than the force
of his will (though he usually adds a wave of the hand and a short incantation just for show). In addition to his vast repertoire of learned spells, he carries several enchanted items (see below), and his magical powers reduce his need to eat or sleep.
While Brimstone naturally possesses great magical talent, it’s possible (but not necessarily true) that some of his magical power results from the fact that he’s got a demon’s soul instead of his own. But even if the demonsoul gives him power, it also creates many difficulties for him. Most prominently, in times of stress he’s prone to trans- forming into the demon — the demonsoul takes control of him entirely, submerging his personality beneath its own and altering his form and powers to demonic ones. This most often happens when he becomes angry or suffers an injury, but it can also occur when he uses too much of his mystic power, or sometimes for no discernible reason
at all. (In the case of his Accidental Change for using more than 60 points’ worth of his VPP Pool in a single Phase, make the roll each Phase, with the roll increasing by 1 for each Phase he main- tains that level of power use.) At the GM’s option, Brimstone’s Accidental Change rolls might be reduced a point or two for a day if he performs some particularly selfless good deed; the “good karma” this builds up makes it easier to quell the demonsoul.
When Brimstone transforms into the demon, he remains in demon form until the demon has acted for a minimum of one Phase. Then he and the demon begin engaging in EGO Roll Contests every Phase: if the demon wins, it remains in existence; if Brimstone wins, he regains control of the demon and reverts back to his normal form at the end of that Phase. The demon may also lose control if it takes BODY damage, if it uses too much of its own power, or sometimes for no reason anyone can fathom.
During his studies and adventures Josiah Brimstone has acquired several enchanted items of great power. The most daunting of these is Gloomspire, which resembles a sword too long to be held in one hand, though Brimstone can hold it one-handed with ease. It appears to be made out of some strange, greyish metal that seems to eat the light rather than reflect it. But it’s not actually a sword in the traditional sense — it’s more of a spiritual weapon. When it touches someone, it can cause great pain, even unto death, but it can also inflict emotional or mental torment, diminish the victim’s force of personality, weaken or corrupt him, and so forth. Gloomspire has a terrifying reputation among the Mystic World; Brimstone’s causing it to manifest is enough to give most mystics opposing him pause. (More than a few
of them consider it an evil object, and Brimstone doubly evil for using it.)

Equally dangerous in its own way, but far less intimidating in appearance or effect, is the Phan- tasmagoric Flame Of Falthagar, which Brimstone took from the evil dimensional overlord of the same name after winning a contest of power.
The Flame resembles an ordinary bit of fire... attached to a finely-wrought silver necklace as if
it were some gemstone! Even more disturbingly, while hanging from the necklace the Flame burns downward, contrary to gravity. It doesn’t burn the wearer, and Brimstone usually wears it under his shirt were people can’t see it. If necessary, he can pull the Flame from the chain and hurl it at an enemy. Depending on what he wills, it can strike
a single person, form a fireball, or the like. After it strikes, the Flame leaps back to Brimstone’s hand to be thrown again or re-attached to the chain. Brimstone can also detach the Flame and hold it in his hand instead of throwing it; a person who gazes at the Flame while he’s holding it can be made more susceptible to Mental Powers as long as Brimstone keeps waving it in front of their eyes.
Not an attack, but as useful in its own way as either Gloomspire or the Flame, is the Book of Forlorn Imprecations, a special deck of tarot cards Brimstone crafted himself. If he takes the time
to do a reading, he gains glimpses of the future... though not always very precise ones.
One of Brimstone’s instructors gave him the Ring Of Eyes, which looks like a finger-ring with a living human eye where a decorative stone might otherwise be, and etchings of other eyes along the rest of the band. On command these eyes all float out of the ring and encircle Brimstone’s head in a slowly-rotating halo, giving him the ability to see all around himself at once.
Campaign Use: Josiah Brimstone is intended as a sort of unpredictable quantity you can thrust into your campaign. On the one hand, there are times when his knowledge and power could be of great help to the PCs (though admittedly there’s always some risk when one gets involved with him). On the other hand, when his negative side has the upper hand — or even worse, when the demon- soul takes over — he’s a powerful and deadly foe. His “Demonsoul Embodied” form should be tough enough to take on most teams of heroes; if not, consider boosting its powers until it is.
Several intriguing questions surround Josiah Brimstone. First, do demons really have souls?
If so, that would seem to have some unusual theological implications. If not, what did Belial put inside young Collin Kildare? Second, if Brimstone succeeds in getting his own soul back and ridding himself of the demonsoul, will it cost him his powers entirely, or diminish them? Third, why didn’t Belial just kill him? Obviously, it wasn’t really by mere whim that Belial left him alive and in the grip of the demonsoul. It didn’t take long for Brimstone to realize the arch-devil had a purpose in leaving him alive. It probably has something to do with wanting to exploit Brimstone’s power... but given the wicked cleverness of the likes of Belial, it could be almost anything.

From Robert Caliburn (see CU 92, 145) Brimstone’s learned of a potent mystical artifact called the Soul Gem, one of four Elemental Gems of unknown origin (Caliburn himself possesses one — the Flame Gem). It’s possible that the Soul Gem could be a big help in Brimstone’s quest to regain his own soul. But no one seems to know who possesses it (if anyone), or where it is... or if they do, they’re not telling.
To make Brimstone tougher, increase the size of his VPP (and/or how much of it he can use at once without the risk of triggering the demon- soul), give him more powers outside of it, and/or increase his SPD to 6-7. To weaken him, get rid of Gloomspire and the Phantasmagoric Flame.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Josiah Brim- stone doesn’t really have any allies in the Mystic or Superhuman Worlds... or any major enemies either, for that matter. He’s so unpredictable and dangerous that no one wants anything to do with him if they can help it.
Appearance: Josiah Brimstone is a white male who looks like he’s in his late twenties. He stands 6’0” and weighs about 175 pounds; he’s got
a rather thin, sometimes almost gaunt, build that conceals the great reserves of physical and spiritual strength within him. His hair is dark and often a little unruly; his complexion is pale, his face clean-shaven. He usually wears ordinary men’s clothes, often with a black trenchcoat or Inverness cloak over them.

JOSIAH BRIMSTONE FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Josiah Brimstone if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll. The best Skills for this would be KS: The Mystic World or the like; Brimstone doesn’t usually mingle with the full Superhuman World.
N/R: Josiah Brimstone is a supermage of great power; he also wields several powerful magical weapons. He’s consid- ered very dangerous by most mystics.
K/R: Brimstone is selfish, arrogant, snide, sarcastic, insult- ingly judgmental, and annoyingly cryptic at the best of times, and often descends into pure cruelty and evil. He’s also given to fits of violent rage; stress (such as being in combat) or exposure to holy magics are particularly likely to trigger his anger.
-1: Brimstone’s negative personality traits are a result of having a demon trapped within his body. When stressed or subject to certain other conditions he may lose control of the demon, allowing it to take over his body and wreak havoc in the world.
-2: Brimstone doesn’t have a demon trapped inside him, as most people think — he’s actually had his own soul replaced with a demon’s soul!
-6: The demon who replace Brimstone’s soul with a demon’s soul is Belial, one of the most powerful Dukes of Hell.
-10: His Secret Identity is Collin Kildare.
