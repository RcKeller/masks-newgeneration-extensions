Background/History: Lots of kids are fascinated by superheroes. Like dinosaurs, they represent something larger and more powerful than them- selves, but which isn’t threatening. In fact, a lot of kids want to become superheroes, the same way other kids want to become famous athletes or rock stars.
William Chow was different. He wasn’t inter- ested in admiring or emulating superheroes. He wanted to beat them. To him, they represented a challenge. As a young man, he spent a lot of time figuring out ways to trick or defeat superheroes, overcome their powers, and show them he was better than they are. This might have remained little more than a harmless hobby, but then his great aunt died unexpectedly, leaving him a small fortune in her will. Now he could do more than just dream — he had the means to act on his ideas. He used the bequest to fund his initial training, and to buy weapons from the underworld armorer Wayland Talos (he’s since learned how to make his own gadgets).
His first outing as a supervillain was a complete success. The Sentinels never knew what hit them; they thought they were responding to a bank robbery by the Ultimates, but what they were actually walking into was a carefully-planned trap. Seeing one of the world’s most powerful super- teams lying unconscious at his feet only confirmed to him that he was right all along: just because someone has superpowers doesn’t mean an ordi- nary human can’t overcome him.
Since then, Utility has become known as one of the most effective and successful super-merce- naries available. Although his interest in defeating and humiliating superheroes, rather than stealing huge sums of money or completing his assigned mission, sometimes causes problems, his track record speaks for itself and keeps the job offers pouring in.
Personality/Motivation: Disciplined, calm in crisis, and tactically alert at all times, Utility is a dangerous foe who gives credit for his victories
to his attitude and intelligence, not his weapons. Outwitting and defeating superheroes is his obses- sion, but unlike most supervillains he doesn’t broadcast his intentions, gloat over fallen foes, or ruthlessly mock his opponents. The quiet enjoy- ment of leaving the battlefield a winner is enough for him. To other supervillains, he’s something
of a paradox: he likes to beat heroes, but he won’t kill them (or let his allies kill them, either, if he can help it); he’s a skilled planner, fighter, and even leader, but doesn’t spend much time with
his colleagues-in-crime. The truth is, he dislikes most other villains (and people in general). He doesn’t think of himself as a “villain” at all, really, and doesn’t approve of or appreciate their attitudes or actions. Fighting superheroes is about proving who’s best, not about gratuitously hurting people or making one’s self rich.

EXAMPLE POWERS FOR aRMORY POWER POOL

Cloaking Mesh: This device, built into one of Utility’s costumes, bends light around him so people cannot see him.
Invisibility to Sight Group, Reduced Endurance (0 END; +1⁄2) (30 Active Points); OIF (-1⁄2). Total cost: 20 points.
Flare Beam: This weapon attaches to the Omni-Pistol; it lets Utility blind and disorient his foes.
Sight Group Flash 12d6 (60 Active Points); OAF (-1), 4 Charges (-1). Total cost: 20 points.
Knockout Gas Mini-Grenades: Enemies who can withstand powerful energy bolts often have little resistance to Utility’s knockout gas.

UTILITY FACTS
Here are some facts characters and NPCs might know about Utility if they succeed with an appropriate Skill Roll:
N/R: Utility is a supervillain who became a costumed criminal to chal- lenge superheroes using only his carefully-trained body and mind,
and the weapons and gadgets he’s designed. His main weapons are his Omni-Pistol (which fires a variety of energy beams), his wrist-rockets, and his billy club.
K/R: Utility has no interest in killing or harming super- heroes; he simply wants to show that he, a normal person without powers, can defeat and humiliate them.
-1: Other weapons and gadgets Utility uses include shock gloves, springboots, and a shunt field belt, but he can build himself just about any device he needs given enough time. He’s also a skilled hand-to-hand fighter.
-4: Utility and Mirage have had an on-again, off-again romantic relation- ship for years.
-6: Utility can’t with- stand interrogation (much less torture); he’s quick to tell whatever he knows once captured and “grilled.”
-10: His Secret Identity is William Chow.

Campaign Use: Utility works well either in a group or on his own, though you’ll probably have the most fun with him as a solo villain. In that case, you have to arrange the scenario so that Utility
has enough of an edge to take on the whole team. This may involve giving him more equipment
and resources than normal (including, perhaps, Computers or Vehicles), but it also means having him do a lot of preparatory work. He should know the PCs almost as well as they know themselves, and plan things so the battles take place where he wants them to. (On the other hand, sometimes
he sneaks into a team’s headquarters and tries to take them all out in their home territory; that’s just about the best sort of victory he can have.) He should have ways to counteract or avoid any just about power the PCs are known to have, forcing them to rely on their own smarts rather than just raw power.
If you want to make Utility more powerful, the best thing to do is increase the size of his Variable Power Pool so he can have more (and perhaps better) gadgets at once. Weakening him usually means decreasing his VPP and the reserves of his Multipowers.
Associates, Allies, And Adversaries: Utility usually works on his own, though he sometimes teams up with like-minded villains (such as Mirage) or works for master villains who share his agenda (at least to some degree). He generally prefers not to work with villains who are actually superpowered, but he makes exceptions if neces- sary. For example, Interface hired him in 2003
as part of his (Interface’s) elaborate plot to study and then defeat the Champions. He was easy to work with and paid well; Utility would gladly take another job from him. He’s also had good working experiences or partnerships with Merc-Force 1, Cybermind, Stiletto, and Shrinker.
Utility has had an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Mirage for years. Drawn together by their mutual dislike of superhumans and love of showing their “normal human” superi- ority over them, they’ve committed many a crime together and in their better periods even consid- ered getting married a time or two. Unfortunately, their respective egos and desire to outdo one another ultimately get in the way and break them up... until something happens to start the whole cycle of attraction/rivalry all over again.
And she’s not the only woman he’s got a rivalry with. Utility and Signal Ghost sometimes “compete” to see who can most quickly defeat a hero, though he regards her Phase Suit as being a little too close to superpowered “cheating.”
Utility maintains informal contact via e-mail with other supervillains who are inventors or are known for their technological acumen, such as Brainchild, Wayland Talos, and Lady Blue. They exchange information and bounce ideas off one another.

Appearance: Utility’s costume is a brown bodysuit with green boots, belt, gauntlets, and attachments. He carries his Omni-Pistol in a holster on his left hip, and his Billy Club in a sheath on his right leg. His Wrist Rockets are on his left wrist. Depending on his current selection of gadgets and weapons, his headpiece is either
a helmet with his Omni-Visor built into the faceplate, or a helmet- like mask with a bar-like Omni-Visor attachment over his eyes.
William Chow is 5’8” tall, weighs 150 pounds, and has the rock-solid build of a muscular athlete and experienced fighter. A Chinese-American, he has short dark hair and dark eyes.
Quote: “All the superpowers in the world aren’t enough to defeat the world’s most powerful weapon — the human brain — if it’s used properly.”
Powers/Tactics: Utility is a clever combatant who uses high-tech weapons and gadgets — most often his Omni-Pistol, which has a variety of settings, each with a different special effect — to overcome superpowered opponents and prove he’s better than they are. Since he knows he can’t match their raw power, he plans ahead to take advantage of his enemies’ weaknesses and vulnerabilities. He researches superhumans extensively, and if a hero has shown a Vulnerability, Susceptibility, or other weakness, it’s likely Utility knows about it — and is ready to exploit it.
If he’s working with a team of supervillains, Utility prefers to find cover and act as fire support, sniping at opponents to soften them up for his teammates. He may even build gadgets specifi- cally designed to enhance or work with his allies’ powers (his Armor Weakener is a particular favorite). If he’s on his own, he tries to arrange the battlefield to suit himself, even rigging it ahead
of time with traps, weapon caches, and anything else he can think of to give him the edge he needs to win.
