BACKGROUND
Dr. Lemuel Zodius was always fascinated with the stars. That fascination led the shy and bookish young man to study astronomy, but his true passion was astrology, and the notion that the stars controlled the mechanisms of fate. His work suffered and his fringe theories began creeping out, until he was laughed out of the scientific community and dismissed from his university position.
Sinking even deeper into obsession, Dr. Zodius stumbled upon scattered fragments referring to the legendary “Zodiac Gems,” ancient stones imbued with the power of the constellations themselves. He learned some elementary magic, but remained focused on his goal.
Eventually, Zodius’ obsessive quest bore fruit: He found the scattered Zodiac Gems and, one by one, gathered them all, setting them into the pectoral breastplate he prepared according to ancient rituals. With the gems united, he was able to wield their power as ... Dr. Zodiac!
