        "content": "<p>Absolutely—here are <strong>10 crisp, contestable Lessons</strong> you can teach the Newborn <strong>in Chinatown</strong> this session. Each is phrased like something an adult or teammate might say, designed to be <em>true enough to follow</em> but <em>flawed enough to cause drama</em>—perfect for Masks. I’ve paired each with <strong>where to trigger it</strong>, <strong>who might teach it</strong>, and <strong>what happens if they follow it literally vs. challenge it</strong>, plus <strong>hooks to your specific PCs/NPCs</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Use 3–4 on-screen and bank the rest. Let adults (Sharon/Switchgear), peers (Wendy), or the city itself teach them. When the Newborn follows a Lesson to the letter and it causes trouble, spotlight consequences and Labels/Influence. When they challenge one, let that strain relationships—<em>play to find out.</em></p></blockquote><hr /><h2>1) “<strong>All bodies stay together.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Side streets as the crowd forms; Switchgear wanders off; fans pull Arpeggio away.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Switchgear (“We roll as one.”)<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They refuse to split to save someone → miss a time‑sensitive rescue.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They peel off with Wendy → Sharon brings consequences.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Arpeggio’s fans (Fiddle Fiends) physically tug him away; Turtle Tamer tries to isolate someone; The Director loves to cut the team into panels.</p><hr /><h2>2) “<strong>Never go inside someone’s mind or body without consent.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Helio’s telepathy buzz; selfie swarm; a panicking civilian.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Helio (and Jack, by example).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They won’t scan a bystander who’s clearly compromised → ambush lands.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They probe someone to ‘help’ → headlines about invasive powers; Sharon’s paperwork.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Jack opens up at street level; Helio models boundaries; later ties to outing/secret-ID tensions.</p><hr /><h2>3) “<strong>Safety before spectacle.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Pop-up stage forms around Arpeggio; phones everywhere.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Sharon…while pointedly staring at Arpeggio.<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They shut down Arpeggio’s impromptu set → audience turns ugly; Arpeggio bristles.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They lean into the show → Accordion Thief crashes; collateral at the jeweler.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Arpeggio’s <strong>Time for the Show</strong> impulses vs. public optics; The Director exploits either choice.</p><hr /><h2>4) “<strong>Property can be replaced; people can’t.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Hot‑oil spill, noodle nets, storefront scuffles; the jeweler’s case.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Wendy (earnest), or Switchgear (pragmatic).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They suplex a villain through a display → AEGIS billing and bad press.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They protect the shop, let a goon escape with a hostage → moral hangover.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Accordion Thief taunts them from behind the jeweler; Sharon’s PIP after the dust settles.</p><hr /><h2>5) “<strong>Obey the plan…until you must break it to save someone.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Curfew/return order: “All bodies present. Leave at 8pm.”<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Switchgear (they/them).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They pull out right at 8:00 → someone (Wendy? a civilian?) is left in harm’s way.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They overstay → reinforcements trap them; clinic fallout.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Sets up a gut‑check moment for leadership; perfect for team argument scenes.</p><hr /><h2>6) “<strong>Money isn’t love or permission.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Sharon’s envelope to Kris; Lycra World (Nonsufficient Funds); toy store hype.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Sharon (transactional), contrasted by peers (relational).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They try to fix harm by “paying for it” → card declines; escalation with staff.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They refuse to spend on themselves or others → teammates feel dismissed; Kris bristles.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Tailor/Lycra World scene turns tense; Casshan can offer a pragmatic fix vs. a human one.</p><hr /><h2>7) “<strong>If someone tries to isolate you, call for a teammate.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Turtle Tamer pulls a PC into an alley; Director’s ‘solo shot’ framing.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Wendy (burned by a past team), or Switchgear.<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They hesitate to engage one‑on‑one → TT slips away with intel.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They follow alone → classic ambush, condition hits, or leverage captured.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Great for the Newborn learning <em>how</em> to ‘call’ (“Team, I need you!”); strengthens bonds.</p><hr /><h2>8) “<strong>Anger is information, not instruction.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Wendy’s rudeness; Nullpoint’s headache; shopkeeper snapping about broken displays.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Helio (naming emotions), or Jack (disarmingly literal empathy).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They acknowledge feelings and choose not to escalate → de‑escalation scene.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They treat anger as threat → shove, flare, or “power as first resort,” cue backlash.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Gives Nullpoint room to step away for self‑care; offers the Newborn a Comfort/Support beat.</p><hr /><h2>9) “<strong>Ask first; then act fast.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Crowd control choices, hot stoves, blocked exits, “Who’s in charge here?”<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Casshan (diagnose before cut), or Switchgear (quick assessment).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They stop to ask in a split‑second crisis → someone gets burned; guilt.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They leap without asking → save the day but misread a boundary; social fallout.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Lets Casshan mentor them (procedural know‑how) vs. Arpeggio’s instinctive flair.</p><hr /><h2>10) “<strong>Retreat is a tactic, not a failure.</strong>”</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> When injuries mount; clinic route opens; the clock hits 7:59.<br /><strong>Taught by:</strong> Sharon (risk aversion) or Wendy (hard‑won experience).<br /><strong>Follow literally:</strong> They call a retreat early → villain escapes; team frustration.<br /><strong>Challenge it:</strong> They refuse to withdraw → clinic fight later is nastier; conditions pile on.<br /><strong>Hooks:</strong> Sets up Scenario C cleanly; spotlights who the Newborn will listen to in a crunch.</p><hr /><h3>Bonus quick prompts (swap‑ins or add‑ons)</h3><ul><li><p>“<strong>Secrets belong to the person, not the keeper.</strong>” (Don’t ‘out’ a hero to the crowd.)</p></li><li><p>“<strong>Say what you need out loud.</strong>” (Nullpoint asks for quiet; Newborn learns boundaries.)</p></li><li><p>“<strong>You can’t save </strong><em><strong>everyone</strong></em><strong>—choose who you save on purpose.</strong>” (Hard moral fork during chaos.)</p></li></ul><hr /><h3>How to deploy in play</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Voice of the city:</strong> Let shop signs, PSAs, or bystanders <em>say</em> a Lesson first; then have an adult echo it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Teachable moments:</strong> When the Newborn acts, ask: “Is that because you believe X?” If yes, push consequences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Labels &amp; Influence:</strong> When a Lesson causes friction, spotlight who’s shifting the Newborn’s Labels and why.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tie to clocks:</strong> “Leave at 8pm” + “Retreat is a tactic” → turn the clock into a character.</p></li></ul><p>If you want, I can condense these into a one‑page <strong>Lesson Card</strong> you can hand the Newborn player (with blanks to check “followed” or “challenged” this session).</p>"
